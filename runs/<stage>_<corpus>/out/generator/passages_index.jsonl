Banks should focus on reaching profitability and the ability to achieve organic capital generation within a reasonable time period following authorisation, recognising that the longer they are unprofitable, the more uncertainty there is about whether investor sentiment will remain positive. By around three years post-authorisation, the PRA expects banks to have more clarity over their path to profitability. By five years post-authorisation, banks should either be profitable or have a credible strategy to achieve profitability, with definite capital support to achieve this. If the firm is of a size to require minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) at greater than minimum capital requirements within this planning horizon, it needs to factor in those requirements (see paragraph 4.4 ). The PRA, however, recognises that a number of factors, including the nature of the business model, could impact the path to profitability, and will apply flexibility in exceptional circumstances where the path to profitability is credible and there is sufficient financial resources in place in advance to manage the risks around that path. At least until profitability is achieved, the PRA expects firms to have a credible capital plan which will ensure new capital is injected in good time to avoid capital requirements plus buffers being entered.

To mitigate the risk of under-calibration of these rating systems due to inaccurate estimation of their cyclicality, the PRA expects that when firms calibrate their residential mortgage rating systems by uplifting internal observed default rates to a long-run average, they should do so on the assumption that the cyclicality of each rating system is no more than 30% in those years where grade level internal observed default rates are not available. This cyclicality cap is the PRA\u2019s expectation of what firms should assume is the maximum level of cyclicality when imputing missing historical default rates. If 30% of the change in portfolio default rates comes from grade migration the remaining 70% would come from change in default rates within grades. Therefore when calibrating the long-run average default rates to assign to each rating grade the PRA expects firms to assume that at least 70% of the portfolio change in default rate reflects grade level changes in default rate. This level reflects the PRA\u2019s current view of an appropriately conservative assumption for rating system cyclicality in light of recent experience. This expectation may be adjusted by the PRA if it judges that there has been a change in the risk of under-calibration.", "passage_id": "pra_rulebook__www.prarulebook.co.uk_guidance_supervisory-statements_ss11-13--internal-ratings-based-irb-approaches::p000107"}
