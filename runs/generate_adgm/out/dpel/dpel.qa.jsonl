Though further evaluation and/or exploration work is required to establish sufficient confidence that the production target will be met, there is no certainty that further evaluation and/or exploration work will result in the determination of indicated mineral resources or that the production target itself will be realised.

There is no certainty that further evaluation and/or exploration work will result in the determination of indicated mineral resources or that the production target itself will be realised.” (7) if the Production Target is in part based on an Exploration Target: (a) a statement of the factors that lead the Mining Reporting Entity to believe that it has a reasonable basis for disclosing a Production Target based, in part, on an Exploration Target; and (b) an at least equally prominent, and proximate, statement to the effect that: “The potential quantity and grade of an Exploration Target is only conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to determine a Mineral Resource and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Mineral Resources or that the Production Target itself will be realised.”"}}
