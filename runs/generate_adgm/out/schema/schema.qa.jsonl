This immediate notification obligation also aligns with the broader set of circumstances in which the Regulator is prohibited from transmitting a notice—such as where it considers the Fund Manager or the Public Fund does not comply with applicable legislation, or may in the future not comply—because in each case the Regulator’s prohibited act (transmitting) results in a decision not to transmit, and that decision must be promptly communicated to the Fund Manager [#TGT:02c6d009-e171-41d6-adac-aaaaf2b66e5a].", "pair_uid": "3cc9505651aa6773", "source_passage_uid": "de227401-76fb-48e7-90c5-1fe0553a4657", "target_passage_uid": "02c6d009-e171-41d6-adac-aaaaf2b66e5a", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769684427, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "shall immediately notify the Fund Manager of its decision", "citation_hook": "Rule 3.2.5", "source_item_type": "Obligation", "target_item_type": "Prohibition", "answer_spans": [{"text": "The Regulator shall not transmit a notice under Rule 3", "start": 0, "end": 54, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}

This is a required action tied to the dismissal/resignation event under the relevant Rule 8 condition, and it focuses on communicating the reasons to the Regulator. Separately, where a firm’s Financial Services Permission is withdrawn, the approved status of its Approved Persons is also withdrawn on the same date; however, that change in status does not remove the obligation to provide the statement when an Approved Person has been dismissed or requested to resign. In practical terms, even if the firm is dealing with withdrawal of its permission and the Approved Person’s approved status ends automatically at the same time, the compliance step of submitting the reasons statement still needs to be completed. The firm should therefore ensure the Authorised Person prepares and delivers the statement of reasons to the Regulator whenever the dismissal/resignation trigger occurs, regardless of the permission-withdrawal context.

This combined approach ensures the classification is grounded in the Rules’ specified criteria while also aligning the outcome with the Target’s two-route structure for Professional Client classification [#SRC:fcb1c541-c9fe-414d-b3a5-f50678fc40a3] [#TGT:9a802537-4320-4c78-9b40-8bad9941e285].", "pair_uid": "f30b98a9fc6347a2", "source_passage_uid": "fcb1c541-c9fe-414d-b3a5-f50678fc40a3", "target_passage_uid": "9a802537-4320-4c78-9b40-8bad9941e285", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769689351, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "the criteria to be classified as a Professional Client", "citation_hook": "COBS Rule 2.4.1", "source_item_type": "Definition", "target_item_type": "Definition", "answer_spans": [{"text": "There are two routes through which a Person may be classified as a Professional Client:\n(a)\t\"deemed\" Professional Clients; and\n(b)\t\"assessed\" Professional Clients", "start": 0, "end": 162, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}

Second, variation is permitted only where there is a procedural trigger connected to the person affected by the Direction: the variation may be made on the application of that person or with that person’s consent. The SOURCE expresses this as varying a Direction “on the application of, or with the consent of, the person to whom it applies,” while the TARGET mirrors the same condition by referring to “the person to whom it relates.” Read together, the consistent requirement is that a variation depends on either an application from, or consent by, the person the Direction applies/relates to, whereas revocation does not carry that stated condition.

On the one hand, the Regulator may revoke (cancel) a Direction; neither passage adds any extra condition such as needing an application or consent for that revocation. On the other hand, changing (varying) a Direction is permitted only if the person affected by the Direction is involved in one of two ways: either that person applies for the change, or that person consents to it. The SOURCE states the variation can occur “on the application of, or with the consent of, the person to whom it applies,” and the TARGET uses equivalent wording by referring to “the person to whom it relates.” Taken together, the practical rule is: revocation is available as a direct option for the Regulator, but variation requires a request from, or agreement by, the person the Direction is about.

However, compliance must separately assess whether the person possesses “Inside Information” in relation to the relevant Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, Accepted Spot Commodities, or certain Related Instruments. Inside Information is defined as information of a precise nature that is not generally available, that relates directly or indirectly to one or more Reporting Entities or Issuers or to the instruments themselves, and that would be likely to have a significant effect on price if it were generally available. If those definitional elements are met, the analysis cannot rely solely on the permission regarding execution of one’s own intention; the key question becomes whether the trade is connected to such non-public, price-sensitive, precise information. The permission and the definition must therefore be applied together in any assessment.

The permission is narrow: executing one’s own pre-formed trading intention does not, of itself, constitute insider dealing, so the act of implementation alone is not treated as the breach trigger. [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] Separately, Inside Information is defined for Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, Accepted Spot Commodities, and certain Related Instruments (excluding Commodity Derivatives) as information that is precise, not generally available, related directly or indirectly to Reporting Entities or Issuers or to the instruments, and likely to have a significant effect on price if made generally available. [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] Compliance should therefore treat “intention plus execution” as not automatically problematic, but must still test whether the person’s informational position fits the Inside Information definition.

[#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] So the correct approach is: execution of the plan alone is not enough to show wrongdoing, but you must still test whether the person had precise, non-public, price-sensitive information connected to the asset or its issuer/entity.", "pair_uid": "302e1577b041697f", "source_passage_uid": "78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7", "target_passage_uid": "ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769691558, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "carrying out of his own intention will not", "citation_hook": "section 92(2)", "source_item_type": "Permission", "target_item_type": "Definition", "answer_spans": [{"text": "In relation to Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, Accepted Spot Commodities or Related Instruments which are not Commodity Derivatives, Inside Information is information of a Precise nature which—\n(a)\tis not", "start": 0, "end": 220, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}
