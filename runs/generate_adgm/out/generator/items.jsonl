[#TGT:a9b5571e-2d13-4cb0-b58f-9c251e6bd215] For an open-ended Collective Investment Fund, the assessment should cover (and the Business Rules should be designed to take into account) the extent to which the Units are distributed to the public, whether there are appropriate market-making arrangements or, alternatively, whether the Fund Manager provides suitable arrangements for investors to redeem the Units, and whether investors receive sufficient transparency on value through periodic publication of the net asset value.

[#SRC:b0cdb789-c9b6-4f36-a6b3-bf1e213d2007] When the derivative exposures are being assessed under SA-CCR, the firm must ensure that the replacement cost (RC) and potential future exposure (PFE) components are computed using different methods depending on whether the relevant netting set is margined or unmargined, so the PFE concept used for the add-on must be aligned to the appropriate margined/unmargined treatment. [#TGT:949c0178-dbd8-44f8-b832-e4c2a327c941] In addition, where the firm determines an exposure at default (EAD) for a margined netting set, it must apply the cap that limits that margined EAD to no more than the EAD that would result if the same netting set were calculated on an unmargined basis.

Where the application handling involves (or triggers) the exercise of the Authority\u2019s Own-Initiative Powers, the Authority should follow the applicable procedures for exercising those powers, ensuring the application is managed consistently with that procedural framework and not separated from it. The procedural alignment is therefore twofold: (i) the recognition application is handled as an \u201capplication for recognition\u201d matter, and (ii) any Own-Initiative Powers component is handled under the corresponding Own-Initiative Powers procedure, with both elements anchored to the relevant FSMR/Rulebook procedures as referenced in the decision-category guidance.

The practical way to choose the right steps is to identify what the Authority is doing in the case: if it is simply processing an application for recognition, it should follow the recognition-application procedure; if, in addition, the Authority is exercising its Own-Initiative Powers as part of the same matter, it should also apply the applicable procedures for exercising those Own-Initiative Powers.

Does carrying out that plan automatically break the rules, and what counts as Inside Information that would raise a concern?", "gold_answer": "Carrying out a person\u2019s own trading intention does not automatically break the rules, because the permission states that implementing one\u2019s pre-formed intention to deal is not, on its own, treated as insider dealing. That means you cannot conclude there is a contravention just because the person planned a trade and then executed it. [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] The concern arises if the person also has \u201cInside Information\u201d about the relevant instruments. Inside Information is defined as information of a precise nature that is not generally available, that relates directly or indirectly to Reporting Entities or Issuers or to the Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, or Accepted Spot Commodities, and that would likely have a significant effect on price if it were generally available (and it also applies to certain Related Instruments that are not Commodity Derivatives). [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] So the correct approach is: execution of the plan alone is not enough to show wrongdoing, but you must still test whether the person had precise, non-public, price-sensitive information connected to the asset or its issuer/entity.", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic", "pair_uid": "302e1577b041697f"}

However, where the Payment Service User is not a Natural Person, the Payment Service User and the Payment Service Provider are permitted to agree in writing that the rules on requests for refund do not apply, and they may also agree that a different time period applies for unauthorised or incorrectly executed Payment Transactions for the relevant refund/redress purposes [#SRC:95fa60a1-7e5a-4d8c-ad0f-194df6db4297]. Read together, the default position is that the Payment Service User must meet the \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d and \u201cno later than twelve months\u201d notification condition to be entitled to redress, but in the specific non-Natural Person scenario the parties can contractually disapply the relevant refund rules and/or replace the default time period with an agreed alternative.

But there is flexibility when the Payment Service User is not a Natural Person: in that case, the Payment Service User and the Payment Service Provider may agree in writing that the rules on requests for refund do not apply, and they may also agree that a different time period applies for unauthorised or incorrectly executed Payment Transactions for the relevant refund/redress purposes [#SRC:95fa60a1-7e5a-4d8c-ad0f-194df6db4297]. Putting these together, the twelve-month deadline is the default condition for redress, but it can be changed by a written agreement between the parties in the non-Natural Person scenario. So you should check whether there is a written agreement that changes the time period; if there is not, the Payment Service User must meet the \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d and \u201cwithin twelve months\u201d notification requirement to remain eligible for redress.", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic", "pair_uid": "bebf350c15f9fc23"}
