After that threshold is met, the Regulator decides whether, in its opinion, the Spot Commodity meets the requirements to be an Accepted Spot Commodity by applying its stated considerations. A key part of that review is the Authorised Person\u2019s requirements for, and standards used, in relation to responsible and sustainable sourcing, including whether the Authorised Person adheres to internationally recognised certification standards where that is applicable to the relevant Spot Commodity.

This is important because the Recognised Clearing House is required to hold capital that is at least equal to the sum of the capital calculated for the specified risks, and some of those required risk components are explicitly tied to gross operational expenses and annual gross operational expenses [#TGT:fedb7b40-56a0-4cc6-97c6-fef115fc6c1b]. For example, the winding down or restructuring activities component is set by reference to six months\u2019 gross operational expenses, and the business-risk component has a minimum amount expressed as a percentage of annual gross operational expenses (even though the Recognised Clearing House must submit its own estimate for approval) [#TGT:fedb7b40-56a0-4cc6-97c6-fef115fc6c1b]. Using the most recent audited annual financial statement data and applying IFRS treatment ensures those expense-based inputs are derived and handled on the required basis when building up the overall capital sum [#SRC:6d70e8b6-10a0-4b13-b3be-912e662e25b0].", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic", "pair_uid": "76e44ab1f733b8f3", "decision": "KEEP", "source_votes": 4, "target_votes": 4}

This requirement connects directly to the obligation to hold capital that is at least the sum of capital calculated for the specified risks, because the required sum includes components that depend on expense measures, including six months\u2019 gross operational expenses for winding down or restructuring activities and a business-risk minimum tied to annual gross operational expenses [#TGT:fedb7b40-56a0-4cc6-97c6-fef115fc6c1b].

Taken together, the framework supports the Regulator\u2019s ability to levy extra charges in high-effort or high-cost cases affecting Applicants/Authorised Persons.
