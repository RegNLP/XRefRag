[#SRC:b5d36396-57ff-473e-8ff9-0e392516e731] That arrangements-based focus aligns with the principle that a Recognised Clearing House is not automatically regarded as non-compliant with its Recognition Requirement merely because it cannot arrange settlement for a particular transaction.

[#TGT:82ade9b4-bba4-449c-815c-32d6ef292b54] Putting the two together for this fact pattern means you cannot rely only on the \u201cExempt Securities\u201d label; you must also treat the SOURCE carve-out as conditional on Rule 4.4.2.

Those grounds are that taking action would be premature or otherwise undesirable in the interests of investors or other market participants; or that the direction is necessary having regard to the public interest in the financial stability of the Abu Dhabi Global Market; or that the direction is necessary to facilitate a proposed or possible use of a power under chapter 16 of COBS, or in connection with a particular exercise of a power under that Part [#SRC:d6293761-3213-4c1c-baf1-930292a4a8c3].", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "c09bf5336e6921c3", "decision": "JUDGE", "source_votes": 3, "target_votes": 4}
