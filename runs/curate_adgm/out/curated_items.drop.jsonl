[#SRC:b5d36396-57ff-473e-8ff9-0e392516e731] FSRA may also look at how the SCSF detects and deals with a Member (or participant) failing to settle, what action it can take to settle a trade when a Member (or participant) does not, how it monitors Members\u2019 settlement performance, and whether it has Default Rules and default procedures.

[#TGT:8f0e941a-957c-499b-952d-fa26d94c0efd] The Regulator then receives representations and generally expects written representations before it will consider oral ones; it will normally only hear oral representations if the Recognised Body or Applicant asks.

At the same time, the scope of non-compliance for a Recognised Clearing House is limited in that it will not be regarded as failing to comply with the Recognition Requirement merely because it is unable to arrange for a specific transaction to be settled [#TGT:a15123d3-b822-401d-9551-e8759dd9e84e]. Read together, this means the FSRA\u2019s assessment can focus on the DSF\u2019s overall arrangements and controls, while recognising that an isolated inability to settle a particular transaction, by itself, does not automatically constitute a Recognition Requirement breach for a Recognised Clearing House.", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "2cfd132d98b94759", "decision": "DROP", "source_votes": 4, "target_votes": 0}

The Source confirms the same category-based scope for Chapter 4 (including the referenced Part) and then adds an important qualification about how provisions operate within that scope: the provisions in the part are applied in a differentiated manner through the Simplified Approach under Section 4.7. Specifically, within the in-scope population, Category 3A firms are required to use the Simplified Approach, while Category 2 firms are permitted (but not required) to use it [#SRC:082e5005-d051-49ac-86ab-930ae5cfbe2f].
