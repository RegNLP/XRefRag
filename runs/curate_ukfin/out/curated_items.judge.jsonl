Where the framework contemplates \u201cpayments deferred\u201d as a relevant input to levy-related calculations (including how levies are calculated after an assumption of liability and other specified calculations) [#SRC:ce527b7017646a7a], the PRA is permitted to defer, in whole or in part, a class A2 member\u2019s obligation to pay its share of a recapitalisation payment levy, but only where the PRA considers that making the contribution would jeopardise the liquidity or solvency of the firm [#TGT:9b64fbbd8245427b]. The deferral is time-limited: it cannot be granted for more than six months at a time [#TGT:9b64fbbd8245427b]. However, the deferral may be renewed, and the renewal is conditional on the firm making a request for renewal [#TGT:9b64fbbd8245427b].

Accordingly, even if an institution can satisfy the conditions to compute a single exposure value at netting set level under its contractual netting agreement [#TGT:1600c3275d4f97ef], a single institution cannot treat that as a basis to permanently combine the relevant methods; that permanent combination is permitted only in the group context and remains prohibited for a single institution acting on its own [#SRC:05cc39f7a09a2d78].", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "a3cf372496fcd472", "decision": "JUDGE", "source_votes": 2, "target_votes": 3}

Putting these together, the netting-set exposure value permission does not remove the prohibition on permanent method-combination for a single institution. So, an institution may be able to compute one exposure value for the netting set if the contractual netting agreement conditions are met [#TGT:1600c3275d4f97ef], but if it is acting as a single institution it still cannot permanently mix the relevant methods; that permanent mixing is only allowed when done within a group [#SRC:05cc39f7a09a2d78].", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic", "pair_uid": "a3cf372496fcd472", "decision": "JUDGE", "source_votes": 3, "target_votes": 3}

Therefore, even where the institution can meet the contractual netting agreement conditions to compute a single netting-set exposure value [#TGT:1600c3275d4f97ef], a single institution cannot permanently combine the relevant methods; that permanent combination is reserved for use within a group and remains prohibited for a single institution acting alone [#SRC:05cc39f7a09a2d78].", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic", "pair_uid": "a3cf372496fcd472", "decision": "JUDGE", "source_votes": 3, "target_votes": 3}
