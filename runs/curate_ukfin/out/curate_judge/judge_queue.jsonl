Matching Adjustment 7.2(3) also requires broad consistency and no bias within the plausible range between firms’ internal credit assessment outcomes and CRA issue ratings at an asset type and the portfolio level. These requirements will help to give the PRA some assurance that the basic FS is appropriate.

To mitigate the risk of under-calibration of these rating systems due to inaccurate estimation of their cyclicality, the PRA expects that when firms calibrate their residential mortgage rating systems by uplifting internal observed default rates to a long-run average, they should do so on the assumption that the cyclicality of each rating system is no more than 30% in those years where grade level internal observed default rates are not available. This cyclicality cap is the PRA’s expectation of what firms should assume is the maximum level of cyclicality when imputing missing historical default rates. If 30% of the change in portfolio default rates comes from grade migration the remaining 70% would come from change in default rates within grades. Therefore when calibrating the long-run average default rates to assign to each rating grade the PRA expects firms to assume that at least 70% of the portfolio change in default rate reflects grade level changes in default rate. This level reflects the PRA’s current view of an appropriately conservative assumption for rating system cyclicality in light of recent experience. This expectation may be adjusted by the PRA if it judges that there has been a change in the risk of under-calibration.", "ir_votes": null, "metadata": null}
