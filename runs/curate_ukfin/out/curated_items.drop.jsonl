An Institution is required to calculate the potential future exposure of a netting set using the specified approach, and that approach must be carried out in a way that includes the required multiplier calculation for the relevant purposes.

The important point is not an arbitrary ordering choice, but that the Institution\u2019s exposure-calculation procedure explicitly incorporates the multiplier-calculation procedure and uses its output in the final exposure figure.

In practice, this means the firm should identify which services fall into the applicable category for its structure, then assess how group-originating risks\u2014such as failures or weaknesses in intragroup providers\u2014could disrupt delivery of those services or operations [#SRC:2799da281c0d7ac4] [#TGT:083adfa9d1ebdfbf].", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic", "pair_uid": "1055dba4bbb9e91e", "decision": "DROP", "source_votes": 4, "target_votes": 2}

Stress testing and scenario analysis must be conducted with regard to all relevant risks in the risk management system for a UK Solvency II firm, the Society and managing agents, and a non-Directive insurer must also conduct stress testing and scenario analysis as part of its risk management system.

In that context, the document\u2019s purpose is to set out the Prudential Regulation Authority\u2019s (PRA\u2019s) expectations of firms specifically in relation to the recognition of deferred tax under Solvency II, so those addressees should treat it as the relevant articulation of the PRA\u2019s expectations on that topic [#SRC:2f64e9f9e9b4b009]. Separately, the update note indicates that, on 21 November 2016, the supervisory statement was updated, with further information available in an appendix for full details [#TGT:db559f0b96781c44]. Read together, this means the scope of who the statement is aimed at remains as stated (UK Solvency II firms and the Lloyd\u2019s market participants identified), while the update note flags that the statement\u2019s content was revised at that date and that users should consult the appendix to understand the nature of the changes when applying the PRA\u2019s expectations.", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "0579ff76866765e0", "decision": "DROP", "source_votes": 4, "target_votes": 0}

Its stated function is to set out the Prudential Regulation Authority\u2019s (PRA\u2019s) expectations of firms on how deferred tax should be recognised under Solvency II, so those groups should use it as the PRA\u2019s expectations document for that subject [#SRC:2f64e9f9e9b4b009].

Putting both pieces together, a UK Solvency II firm should (i) confirm it is within the intended audience and therefore expected to consider the statement\u2019s content on deferred tax recognition, and (ii) be aware that the statement was revised as of that November 2016 date and that the appendix is the place to look to understand what was changed.", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic", "pair_uid": "0579ff76866765e0", "decision": "DROP", "source_votes": 4, "target_votes": 0}

First, when the firm determines the amount of the firm\u2019s exposure to assets under the applicable determination steps, it must increase that exposure by an amount that represents any exposure of the firm\u2019s dependants to assets of the same description, so that dependant exposure is captured in the firm-level exposure measure [#SRC:250709f3ef53e2f6].

In parallel, when the subject matter is reporting information on a group falling within the specified group category, the reporting framework identified in the Reporting Part is to be applied to that reporting information, but adapted as needed (\u201cwith any necessary changes\u201d), and the recipient of that reporting information is the PRA [#SRC:6a1416d81f379d3e]. Read together, this means the firm remains in-scope under the Chapter (because it is not a third country branch undertaking) while the content and mechanics of what must be reported for the relevant group are governed by the referenced Reporting provisions, as adjusted where necessary, and the submission is made to the PRA.

In parallel, when demonstrating that its internal credit assessments are comparable to a credit rating, the firm must structure its process so that internal credit assessment outcomes sit within a plausible range of issue ratings that could have resulted from a CRA, and it must evidence broad consistency and no bias between its internal outcomes and CRA issue ratings at both asset-type and portfolio levels [#SRC:5fd5739308652721].

In that context, the PRA will still require the firm to submit a written application, and the firm must include accompanying documentary evidence with that application [#SRC:974d2778f8f27567].

So, the baseline requirement is always a written application plus documentary evidence, and the change-in-scope case adds a specific expectation to identify and present the relevant changes.
