[#SRC:5292b5d19dc62407] In addition, if the entitlement test includes being a member on a given date (for example, a membership condition like the one referenced at paragraph 3.111(a)), that membership condition likewise cannot be satisfied by relying on an overdrawn share account.

In doing so, the firm should evaluate whether using IFRS as the valuation basis for deferred tax-related provisions is appropriate on the grounds that the provisions are consistent with IFRS and that applying IFRS would not impose disproportionate costs; this cost-proportionality assessment supports the firm’s approach to meeting the deferred tax recognition and valuation obligation [#SRC:ce67e40da8a3c610]. At the same time, the firm must not treat IFRS consistency as disapplying other valuation requirements: the firm should proceed on the basis that the additional valuation provisions referenced as continuing to apply remain applicable alongside the IFRS-consistent approach, and therefore the deferred tax valuation work should be performed in a way that remains aligned with those continuing requirements while still satisfying the all-assets-and-liabilities scope of the deferred tax obligation [#SRC:ce67e40da8a3c610] and [#TGT:d84bdc975f6ad72f].", "source_passage_id": "ce67e40da8a3c610", "target_passage_id": "d84bdc975f6ad72f", "source_text": "", "target_text": "", "metadata": {"method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "e93b1f24fbe706b5"}}

Accordingly, when the FSCS pays the accrued-but-uncredited interest, it must do so in a way that does not cause the depositor’s compensation to exceed the maximum compensation sum applicable to that depositor’s aggregate eligible deposits; the payment of interest is expressly constrained so that it does not lift the compensation above the stated cap [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f] as defined for each depositor [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e].

As a result, the TARGET’s scope is inherently more selective because it requires both (i) satisfaction of the stated “subject to” conditions and (ii) satisfaction of the additional referenced requirements for the loans included in the outstanding balance.

[#SRC:85642c5db4f699c7] The terms “credit rating” and “credit rating agency” are defined in regulation 2(1) of the IRPR regulations, so the firm should use those definitions to identify which assets fall into the CRA-rated category for this purpose. [#TGT:45aa7b23d23d130a] For assets that have CRA-provided credit ratings (as identified using those IRPR definitions), the CQS assignment process for basic FS is described as relatively prescriptive, including any adjustments to reflect differences in credit quality by rating notch, with the firm’s main judgement being how it categorises the asset class. [#SRC:85642c5db4f699c7] By contrast, for internally-rated assets (i.e., assets not relying on a CRA “credit rating” as defined), the firm must exercise more judgement in determining the internal credit assessment and the CQS that should apply.

Accordingly, the firm’s up-to-date identification should not be limited to a subset or a generic description; it must reflect the full set of functions the firm has determined to be key at any given time, and it must be updated when the firm’s view of which functions are key changes. This links the ongoing “keep … up-to-date” requirement in the obligation to the definitional scope of what counts as a key function for inclusion in the identification. The firm therefore needs processes to ensure that whenever it newly considers a function to be a key function, or ceases to consider one as such, its identification is promptly adjusted to continue to include each function it considers key, as required [#SRC:3f1b83e0485737e2] and as delimited by the definition [#TGT:0254821a38c334e7].", "source_passage_id": "3f1b83e0485737e2", "target_passage_id": "0254821a38c334e7", "source_text": "", "target_text": "", "metadata": {"method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "696cb4d085cad809"}}

That means the identification the firm maintains must include each function that the firm itself has decided is a key function, and it must stay aligned with the firm’s current view. Practically, the firm should ensure its identification is complete relative to its own determinations—if the firm considers multiple functions to be key, the identification should cover all of them, not only the most obvious ones.

This means that, when assembling the Merger Document(s) package, the proxy voting forms should be included and described consistently with their role as a proxy appointment instrument, and the covering letter can be used as an accompanying document within the same set of materials.

So, when Institutions carry out the required establishment and transaction assignment, they should use “j” as the way to refer to the full collection of interest risk rate hedging sets that have been established for that netting set. This helps ensure that transaction assignment for interest risk rate is done against the complete, defined set of established hedging sets (i.e., the ones “j” denotes), rather than against an incomplete or informal list.

Read together with the TARGET, this non-derogable status reinforces two prohibitive constraints on a firm’s treatment of financial liabilities: first, the firm must apply the specified valuation approach at initial recognition for financial liabilities referred to in UK-adopted international accounting standards, rather than using an alternative approach; and second, after initial recognition the firm is expressly prohibited from making any subsequent adjustment that takes account of changes in the firm’s own credit standing [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6]. In combination, the passages indicate there is no permissible carve-out or discretionary departure from the initial-recognition valuation requirement, and the prohibition on subsequent own-credit adjustments operates as an additional, specific restriction on later measurement.

Accordingly, the firm’s documentation and internal analysis for the relevant subsidiaries should reflect both (a) the Bank-view-informed comparability assessment and (b) the fact that the referenced update is dated July 2019, as the linked update is the identified point-in-time reference for the approach being applied [#SRC:2d629999d9d3cb6a] [#TGT:84ab4a624228cd6e].", "source_passage_id": "2d629999d9d3cb6a", "target_passage_id": "84ab4a624228cd6e", "source_text": "", "target_text": "", "metadata": {"method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "85959ca778fdaed0"}}

In practical terms, the firm should read any mention of “FS” as pointing to the full three-element structure and should ensure its work (for example, an internal assessment or an external explanation) reflects consideration of each element.

The practical outcome is that the record should name the business unit(s) on each side of the service flow, aligning the provider/recipient identification with the intra-entity nature of the critical service while still meeting the requirement to specify both provider and recipient(s) of the service [#SRC:9a27881b26b46dfd] [#TGT:9c6cdb1878bd46fb].", "source_passage_id": "9a27881b26b46dfd", "target_passage_id": "9c6cdb1878bd46fb", "source_text": "", "target_text": "", "metadata": {"method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional", "pair_uid": "682548fe7be908a3"}}
