At the same time, the firm must ensure the liquidity contingency plan itself meets the relevant PRA Rulebook requirements, because Rule 12 of the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Part sets out the requirements a firm needs to meet in relation to its liquidity contingency plan [#TGT:856519b5145b9260]. Put together, this means the firm should avoid mismatches between the two documents (for example, different processes for identifying liquidity stress or different actions once stress is identified). Even where separation is necessary (such as due to local regulator requirements), the firm should manage the two plans so they operate as a consistent set, with the liquidity contingency plan remaining compliant with Rule 12 while staying aligned with the recovery plan.", "pair_uid": "01cf27de180d12a3", "source_passage_uid": "d6da2dce246d82de", "target_passage_uid": "856519b5145b9260", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769537065, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "any separate documents should be consistent with each other", "citation_hook": "plan 16", "source_item_type": "Obligation", "target_item_type": "Other", "answer_spans": [{"text": "16.", "start": 0, "end": 3, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}
