Read together, the obligation establishes the allocation requirement and the definition establishes the universe of items that are subject to that requirement: the firm must ensure that none of the responsibilities that are “set out in this rule” are left unallocated, because each such responsibility is, by definition, a prescribed responsibility. Accordingly, compliance requires (i) confirming the firm is not within the excluded categories, and then (ii) allocating all responsibilities that the rule itself sets out, to one or more persons who perform, without omitting any responsibility that the definition captures.

Read together, these obligations mean a firm should plan for two different but potentially related reporting streams: (i) an annual AoC package (results plus supporting narrative documentation) submitted to the PRA each year from the specified commencement point, and (ii) an ORSA report submitted promptly after the ORSA is completed, subject to the 10-business-day deadline. The PRA’s encouragement of earlier AoC submission does not alter the ORSA timing requirement, which is framed as a mandatory post-conclusion deadline [#SRC:9003a68c0b5e882c] [#TGT:348990bd4143c14e].", "pair_uid": "9129ed46ca09aafd", "source_passage_uid": "9003a68c0b5e882c", "target_passage_uid": "348990bd4143c14e", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769638170, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "required to submit the results of their annual AoC exercise", "citation_hook": "Reporting 2.5B", "source_item_type": "Obligation", "target_item_type": "Obligation", "answer_spans": [{"text": "must submit the ORSA report", "start": 11, "end": 38, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}

This permission-linked expectation sits alongside the firm’s separate obligation relating to its ORSA process: after the firm concludes its ORSA, it must submit the ORSA report within 10 business days following that conclusion [#TGT:348990bd4143c14e]. In practice, the firm should treat the AoC submission tied to the permission application date as a point-in-time deliverable that may be triggered by the permissions process, while the ORSA report submission is triggered by completion of the ORSA and is governed by a fixed post-event deadline. The two requirements can therefore operate on different timelines (application date versus ORSA conclusion), and both must be met when applicable, with the AoC materials focused on AoC results and narrative support and the ORSA obligation focused on timely delivery of the ORSA report [#SRC:9003a68c0b5e882c] [#TGT:348990bd4143c14e].", "pair_uid": "9129ed46ca09aafd", "source_passage_uid": "9003a68c0b5e882c", "target_passage_uid": "348990bd4143c14e", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769638170, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "required to submit the results of their annual AoC exercise", "citation_hook": "Reporting 2.5B", "source_item_type": "Obligation", "target_item_type": "Obligation", "answer_spans": [{"text": "must submit the ORSA report", "start": 11, "end": 38, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}

Even if a firm submits AoC materials early to support early engagement, it still must meet the ORSA report deadline once the ORSA is concluded.

This procedural step matters because, regardless of the firm’s internal assessment of eligibility, the firm must not apply a matching adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure when calculating the best estimate of its insurance or reinsurance obligations unless it has a matching adjustment permission [#TGT:78efaa111a0c4a1d]. Read together, the written confirmation is part of what the firm provides in its initial application to demonstrate compliance with the eligibility conditions to the PRA, but it does not itself remove the prohibition on use: the firm remains prohibited from applying the matching adjustment in its best estimate calculations until the permission is in place. In practice, the firm should treat the written confirmation (and any supporting documentary evidence where expected) as application material supporting the PRA’s satisfaction, while ensuring it does not apply the matching adjustment for best estimate purposes unless and until permission has been granted [#SRC:706be7f8963a27d5] [#TGT:78efaa111a0c4a1d].", "pair_uid": "695e14bf016d494a", "source_passage_uid": "706be7f8963a27d5", "target_passage_uid": "78efaa111a0c4a1d", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769638672, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "a firm's initial MA application must contain written confirmation", "citation_hook": "Matching Adjustment 3.1", "source_item_type": "Procedure", "target_item_type": "Prohibition", "answer_spans": [{"text": "must not apply a matching adjustment", "start": 7, "end": 43, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}

In practice, the firm should be able to evidence why the intragroup exposure remains consistent with the liability profile (including duration) and why it does not compromise policyholder interests, noting the particular concern that issuers of loans may be less willing or able to enforce repayment, especially for upstream loans [#TGT:19e81bc332eae024].", "pair_uid": "0ed7e6e06f0279bf", "source_passage_uid": "afb7633ef682266c", "target_passage_uid": "19e81bc332eae024", "gen_model": "gpt-5.2-MBZUAI", "gen_ts": 1769638839, "run_seed": 13, "debug_context": {"semantic_hook": "invested in a manner appropriate to the nature", "citation_hook": "39", "source_item_type": "Obligation", "target_item_type": "Obligation", "answer_spans": [{"text": "Investments in, or loans to, other group companies may be in the interests of shareholders but they may not necessarily be in the best interests of policyholders", "start": 227, "end": 388, "type": "FREEFORM"}], "target_is_title": false}}

Legally, an amount secured on property is treated as an excluded liability, but there is an important exception: if the security is a charge that, as created, was a floating charge, that secured amount is not treated as excluded on that basis (Section 377B(1)(d) of FSMA) [#TGT:8a41e3fa3a9296cc]. The PRA then explains how this plays out in practice: it recognises that liabilities secured by floating charges are not excluded liabilities and may therefore be written down, and it links this to avoiding an inappropriate and unintended priority for inward reinsurance creditors who often have floating charges but are contractually subordinated to rank alongside direct policyholders (who have a statutory priority) [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96].
