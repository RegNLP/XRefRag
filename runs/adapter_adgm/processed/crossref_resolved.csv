Rule 6.2.16(1)(e)(vi) recognises that some Recognised Investment Exchanges using, for example, anonymous order books or anonymous indications of interest, allow for the identity of counterparties to sometimes be unknown prior to the effecting of transactions.

Rule 6.2.16 also accepts that some participants in the Price Stabilisation may have accrued uneconomic positions during Price Stabilisation and therefore permits a single transaction, probably at the end-of-day, to square-off the positions between participants. The terms on which these transactions can be carried may often be agreed in the terms of engagement between the Stabilisation Manager and the Stabilisation Agents.  The Regulator may when inspecting records kept relating to Price Stabilisation seek the rationale for any of these transactions and the price at which they were conducted.

Pursuant to FEES Rule 1.2.4, the FSRA reserves its right to impose additional fees in circumstances where a substantial additional regulatory burden is imposed on FSRA. In such circumstances, including the migration of an MTF to become a conventional Securities Recognised Investment Exchange, the FSRA recommends that the Applicant/Authorised Person discuss FEE implications with the FSRA as early as practicable.","Supplementary fees

The use of Virtual Assets raises significant regulatory concerns for regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies worldwide, particularly in relation to Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorism Financing (TF).  International bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International Organisation for Securities Commissions (IOSCO), have issued different Digital Asset (including Virtual Asset and ICO) warnings to investors and market participants advising of the significant risks, including ML and TF risks, and the possibility of Digital Assets being used for wider illegal purposes.

b)	the Reporting Entity has been asked by the Listing Authority to correct or prevent a false market;  or

Pursuant to section 50 of FSMR,  the FSRA is required to maintain the Official List, and may admit to the Official List such Securities as it considers appropriate.  It is important to note that, pursuant to section 50 of FSMR, only the FSRA can maintain an Official List of Securities, and neither Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) nor any other entity within ADGM are able to maintain their own Official List of Securities.  Section 50 of FSMR further provides that in maintaining the Official List, the FSRA may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.  For this purpose, Chapter 7 of MKT sets out the Rules applicable to Market Disclosure or otherwise known as its continuous disclosure framework.

Other Reporting Entity steps to assist with compliance with Rule 7.2.1
The issue set out in paragraph 148h) above is most important, as the need to resolve a continuous disclosure matter may be extremely sensitive, and time critical.  In circumstances where the Listing Authority is not able to contact the Reporting Entity (being the Reporting Entitys designated contact points with the Listing Authority), or the Reporting Entitys designated contacts do not have the organisational knowledge or authority to address the matter promptly, the Listing Authority may Suspend the Listed Entitys Securities until the matter is properly resolved.

","DISCLOSURES – SYSTEMS, CONTROLS & CONTENT
Other Reporting Entity steps to assist with compliance with Rule 7.2.1
Steps or actions that a Reporting Entity can take to help manage its disclosure obligations under Rule 7.2.1 include:

a)	To allow a Reporting Entity to urgently request a Trading Halt without delay, having a template letter ready for use at all times requesting the Listing Authority to grant a Trading Halt.

b)	Anticipating what might happen if the Inside Information leaks about a confidential transaction being negotiated, and have a template Disclosure ready that can be finalised and Disclosed straight away.

c)	Where it has advance notice of an event that is likely to require Disclosure under Rule 7.2.1, preparing a draft Disclosure ahead of time, allowing it to be Disclosed immediately.

d)	Where the event that gives rise to the need to make a Disclosure is within its control, being sensitive to the RIE’s market (upon which the Listed Entity’s Securities are admitted to trading) trading hours and, where possible, looking to ensure the event happens and the Disclosure is made before trading commences  or after trading closes (so as to avoid any disruption to the normal course of trading of the Listed Entity’s Securities of the’RIE's market).

e)	Ensuring that it, and its relevant Officers responsible for communication with the Listing Authority, has the:

(i)	organisational knowledge to have relevant and meaningful discussions on Rule matters; and

(ii)	authority to request a Trading Halt or Suspension and make a Disclosure, if that is what is required under the Rules.

f)	Ensuring that it has appropriate arrangements in place to control, or deny, access to Inside Information (pursuant to Rules 7.2.7 to 7.2.9).  The Listing Authority encourages efforts to keep the numbers of these ‘insiders’ to a minimum.

g)	Ensuring that it has in place arrangements for maintaining the confidentiality of Inside Information before Disclosure.

Aware Letters
When the Listing Authority has concerns that a Reporting Entity may not have Disclosed Inside Information at the time it should have under Rule 7.2.1, it will typically issue an ‘aware letter’ to the Reporting Entity.  The purpose of an ‘aware letter’ is to enable the Listing Authority, and the market in the Listed Entity’s Securities, to be satisfied that the Reporting Entity is in compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations under the Rules.  Aware letters are issued under Rule 2.8.2.  A Reporting Entity must respond to an ‘aware letter’ by the time specified by the Listing Authority in the letter.

Similar to a MAQ Letter, ‘aware letters’ tend to follow a standard template.  Generally, they will identify the information in question and the relevant date it was Disclosed, and ask the following questions:

(i)	Does the Reporting Entity believe the information identified in the letter to be Inside Information (being information that a reasonable person would expect to have a significant effect on the price of the Listed Entity’s Securities)?

(ii)	If the answer to question i) is “yes”, please confirm the following:

i.	When did the Reporting Entity first become aware of the Inside Information identified in the letter? Please include details of the relevant time and circumstances of the Reporting Entity becoming aware of the [key contents of the Inside Information]?

ii.	If the Reporting Entity was aware of the [key contents of the Inside Information] prior to the date of this letter, please advise why the Reporting Entity did not Disclose the Inside Information or request a Trading Halt or Suspension at an earlier time?

In regard to Rule 7.2.1, the first question that an Officer of a Reporting Entity should therefore consider is whether the Reporting Entity is aware of any Inside Information.  If yes, that Officer must consider, immediately,  whether that Inside Information must be Disclosed.  Suitable systems and procedures must therefore be implemented by a Reporting Entity to ensure that Inside Information is promptly identified by, or within, a Listed Entity (in light of the awareness extension discussed in paragraph 38 above) and a decision is taken as to whether a Disclosure is required.
","BECOMING AWARE OF INSIDE INFORMATION
The extension of a Reporting Entity’s ‘awareness’ to include information that its Officers ‘ought reasonably have come into possession of’ (over and above information that its Officers, in fact, ‘know’) means that a Reporting Entity is considered to be ‘aware’ of Inside Information if the information is known by anyone within the Listed Entity, and is of such significance that it ought reasonably to have been brought to the attention of an Officer of the Listed Entity.  Without this extension to the concept of ‘awareness’, a Reporting Entity would be able to avoid, or delay, meeting its continuous disclosure obligations in circumstances where Inside Information had not been brought to the attention of its Officers in a timely manner by others within the Listed Entity.  A Listed Entity will need to ensure that it has in place internal systems, processes and controls to ensure that Inside Information is promptly brought to the attention of its Officers.

Pursuant to section 50 of FSMR,  the FSRA is required to maintain the Official List, and may admit to the Official List such Securities as it considers appropriate.  It is important to note that, pursuant to section 50 of FSMR, only the FSRA can maintain an Official List of Securities, and neither Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) nor any other entity within ADGM are able to maintain their own Official List of Securities.  Section 50 of FSMR further provides that in maintaining the Official List, the FSRA may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.  For this purpose, Chapter 7 of MKT sets out the Rules applicable to Market Disclosure or otherwise known as its continuous disclosure framework.  This Guidance sets out the Listing Authoritys expectations in relation to its continuous disclosure framework, and provides guidance to Reporting Entities to assist their decision making in relation to their continuous disclosure obligations.

It should be noted that the test in section 95 of FSMR of whether information is Inside Information is objective, and the fact that a Reporting Entitys officers may genuinely, and honestly, believe that information is not Inside Information, and that therefore it does not need to be Disclosed, will not avoid a breach of Rule 7.2.1, if that view is ultimately found to be incorrect.

A Virtual Asset Custodian seeking to operate as a DSF may apply to the FSRA to vary its FSP to allow it to expand its Providing Custody operations to do so.  Further guidance on the considerations applicable to entities wishing to operate as a DSF are set out in paragraphs 55  61 above.  Note, however, that with respect to Authorised Persons currently Operating an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets), the FSRA will require the DSF to be a separate legal/operating entity from those entities it is providing settlement services (MIR Rule 3.8) and/or custody services (MIR Rule 2.10) for.

a)	an Offer is directed at Professional Clients other than natural Persons;

b)	an Offer is directed at fewer than 50 Persons in any 12 month period, excluding Professional Clients who are not natural Persons; or

c)	the total consideration to be paid by a Person to acquire Securities is at least USD 100,000, or an equivalent amount in another currency.
