In other words, the trigger for payment is the firm’s engagement (or preparation to engage) in the restructuring activity [#TGT:28f11ba870345a3b], and the calculation step requires including third‑party invoiced fees and disbursements to the PRA that relate to supporting the PRA’s performance of that regulatory work [#SRC:f9e22b9441fa0c58].", "source_text": "(3) Then add any fees and disbursements invoiced to the PRA by any third party provider in respect of services performed for the PRA in relation to assisting the PRA in performing the regulatory work referred to in 5.2 and 5.4 .", "target_text": "An SPF for restructuring becomes payable by a firm if it engages, or prepares to engage, in activity which involves it undertaking or making arrangements with a view to any of the following:", "source_passage_id": "f9e22b9441fa0c58", "target_passage_id": "28f11ba870345a3b", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic"}

This approach ensures the scenario exercise is not merely theoretical, but instead focuses on likely decision pathways and their operational implications, while still supporting the broader demonstration that the recovery plan can be used in multiple stress conditions and that its components interact as intended [#SRC:db5203b384a28349] [#TGT:3cc3932a984e4450].", "source_text": "the selection of the subset of options that would likely be chosen to respond to specific stresses (covered under ‘ (iv) Scenario testing ’ below).", "target_text": "Scenario testing is important for demonstrating that the recovery plan is suitable for use in a range of different types of stress, and testing how different elements of the plan (such as indicators, governance and options) would interact in these stresses.", "source_passage_id": "db5203b384a28349", "target_passage_id": "3cc3932a984e4450", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional"}

The scope language indicates that the requirements are to be applied “with any necessary changes” at the specified entity level, so the reporting duty should be operationalized so it functions appropriately for those non-UK/Gibraltar head office holding company contexts and third-country undertaking contexts while still delivering group-level risk concentration information to the group supervisor [#SRC:4b76a4f92f32f4d8] [#TGT:58ef7092c29ce99f].", "source_text": "When 2.1(3) applies, 4 to 14 , 16 to 19 and External Audit 2 to 4 apply with any necessary changes at the level of the insurance holding company or mixed financial holding company which does not have its head office in the UK or Gibraltar, third country insurance undertaking or third country reinsurance undertaking unless:", "target_text": "(1) Where 2.1(1) or 2.1(2) applies, the relevant insurance group undertakings or any UK holding company must report on a regular basis and at least annually to the group supervisor any significant risk concentration at the level of the group .", "source_passage_id": "4b76a4f92f32f4d8", "target_passage_id": "58ef7092c29ce99f", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional"}

Alongside this system-level coverage obligation, the firm must ensure that the relevant calibration is set so that all quantifiable risks to which the firm is exposed are taken into account, including at least non-life underwriting risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk, market risk, credit risk, and operational risk [#TGT:f261181a95a3ca51]. Together, these requirements mean the firm cannot treat SCR risk coverage as limited to a narrow set of modeled items: the risk-management system must be broad enough to capture SCR-included risks and any residual or excluded risks, while the calibration requirement ensures that, for quantifiable exposures, the firm’s approach explicitly incorporates the minimum specified risk categories and does not leave out other quantifiable risks.", "source_text": "(2) That risk-management system must: (a) be effective and well integrated into the organisational structure and decision-making processes of the firm with proper consideration of the persons who have key functions ; (b) cover the risks to be included in the calculation of the SCR as set out in Solvency Capital Requirement - General Provisions 3.3(1) , as well as the risks which are not, or not fully, included in the calculation thereof; and (c) cover at least the following areas: (i) underwriting and reserving as set out in 3.1A(1) ; (ii) asset-liability management as set out in 3.1A(2) ; (iii) investment risk management, in particular derivatives , quasi-derivatives and similar commitments, as set out in 3.1A(3) ; (iv) liquidity risk and concentration risk management: as set out in 3.1A(4) and 3.1A(5) ; (v) operational risk management as set out in 3.1A(6) ; and (vi) reinsurance and other risk-mitigation techniques as set out in 3.1A(7) .", "target_text": "(1) must be calibrated to ensure that all quantifiable risks to which the firm is exposed are taken into account, including at least the non-life underwriting risk , life underwriting risk , health underwriting risk , market risk , credit risk , and operational risk ;", "source_passage_id": "ec68cf68d094e876", "target_passage_id": "f261181a95a3ca51", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional"}

The SOURCE explains that the detail on the Bank’s indicative thresholds used to set preferred resolution strategies and MREL requirements is in the Bank’s approach to resolution, and it separately notes that thresholds for reporting under the Resolvability Assessment Framework are in the PRA RAF SS 4/19 document on resolution assessment and public disclosure by firms [#SRC:5423b3916f47b476].

{"item_id": "cd1eca00aa0eb7c4", "question": "When submitting an application to the PRA for confirmation of an amalgamation or a transfer of engagements, may the parties include additional narrative in the scrutineers report beyond the required enclosure, and if so, what extra matters does the PRA indicate it would find helpful to be covered where invalid votes appear significant?", "gold_answer": "In an application for confirmation submitted to the PRA, the parties must enclose the scrutineers report as part of the application package, alongside the other required supporting documents (including the certified minutes of the general meeting at which the Merger Resolutions were moved) [#SRC:05dcadd91554d83e]. In addition to that required enclosure, the PRA indicates it is permitted and would be helpful for the scrutineers report to go further than simply reporting the voting outcome by also addressing process quality: it should comment on any procedural difficulties encountered during the voting process and provide an analysis of why votes were found to be invalid, but specifically where the number of invalid votes appears to be significant [#TGT:2c0f6dd7f7e57586]. Read together, this means the scrutineers report is not only a mandatory component of each confirmation application, but it may also be expanded to include diagnostic commentary and root-cause analysis to assist the PRA’s assessment, particularly in cases where invalid voting could be material to the integrity of the member decision-making process.", "source_text": "The parties in an amalgamation should make a joint application for confirmation to the PRA, while the parties to a transfer of engagements should make separate applications for confirmation of the transfer. These applications should specify the date on which the merger is intended to take effect and should be accompanied by two authenticated copies of the Instrument of Transfer, or the amalgamation agreement, and of the Merger Document or separate Schedule 16 Statement. In addition, in the case of an amalgamation, three signed copies of the Memorandum and Rules of the successor 34 to the amalgamating societies should be sent to the PRA and the FCA.
