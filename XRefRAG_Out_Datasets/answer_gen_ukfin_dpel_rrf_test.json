[#SRC:f026573295165d20] [#TGT:9b64fbbd8245427b] The trigger for payment is the point at which paying the deferred amount ceases to jeopardise the liquidity and solvency of the firm, meaning the deferral is not a permanent waiver but a timing adjustment tied to the firm\u2019s financial condition. [#SRC:f026573295165d20] The PRA\u2019s ability to defer applies where it considers that the contributions would jeopardise the liquidity or solvency of the firm, and it may defer the obligation in whole or in part for a class A2 member in relation to a recapitalisation payment levy. [#TGT:9b64fbbd8245427b] Even if the liquidity/solvency concern persists, the PRA cannot grant a single deferral for longer than six months; however, the firm can request renewal, allowing the deferral to be extended through successive periods if renewed.

    "gold_answer": "A firm may only treat part of an income protection contract separately for MA portfolio composition where that part qualifies as an eligible element, and the PRA\u2019s discussion of \u201cin-payment elements\u201d is framed as potentially eligible only when they are separately identifiable and can be organised and managed separately (including in line with regulation 4(6) of the IRPR regulations). [#SRC:aa234508c5cb946b] The general rule for this Part is that insurance or reinsurance obligations under a contract must not be split into different parts when composing the relevant portfolio, except in the case of an eligible element, so any separation of an in-payment element must fit within that exception rather than being a general permission to split obligations. [#TGT:80ba42a4e7626379] In that setting, the permitted underwriting risks connected to the portfolio of liabilities may include recovery time risk, described as the risk that policyholders receiving income protection payments take longer than expected to recover from sickness.

[#TGT:250709f3ef53e2f6] In particular, for the purposes of the firm-level mechanism that brings dependants into the exposure amount, each dependant\u2019s exposure is not taken as a raw figure; instead, it must be calculated by applying the same asset-exposure determination provisions (18 to 22) to that dependant as though the dependant were itself a firm to which those provisions apply, regardless of whether it actually is. [#SRC:d0975ff530ed6e30] This creates a two-step linkage: first, determine the firm\u2019s own exposure to assets in accordance with 18 to 22; second, determine each dependant\u2019s exposure to assets of that description using 18 to 22 applied to the dependant on a \u201ctreat as a firm\u201d basis, and then increase the firm\u2019s amount by the resulting dependant exposure amount (if any).

[#TGT:ad978d8ce164b1e0] Where data required for inclusion are not held or are not applicable, the firm should keep the relevant fields present in the SCV and exclusions view file but leave those fields empty, so the files remain standard in length. [#SRC:697a55e1d316e0fa] The firm should also maintain a consistent field sequence: fields should always appear in the same order as set out in Depositor Protection 12.9, even when some fields are empty.

    "gold_answer": "Yes, a firm can use constructed data when some of the data referred to in 4.13(4) is missing or unreliable, but it must do so within specific limits and still meet the PRA\u2019s expectations for the stressed FS floor. [#TGT:5f5585242ebb290e] The constructed data must be built on prudent assumptions and must be based on available and reliable data relating to the previous 30 years, so the firm cannot construct inputs without grounding them in that historical, reliable dataset.

    "gold_answer": "The insurer should be able to show that any planned dividend payment makes sense when compared to (1) how the business has performed and is expected to perform and (2) the insurer\u2019s capital position now and in the future, and it should do this while taking its documented risk appetite into account.

    "gold_answer": "Where a firm is using IFRS 9 transitional arrangements, the PRA\u2019s decision on whether the firm should hold a larger buffer or strengthen its capital position is based on a combination of prudential factors and a time-limited transitional assessment. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] The PRA expects firms to increase buffers or strengthen capital where necessary in light of factors including the firm\u2019s leverage ratio, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, risks associated with double leverage, and whether potentially significant risks are not fully captured by the stress test. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] In addition, up to the end of 2023, the PRA will assess firms\u2019 capital positions under transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 when firms are using those arrangements. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] This transitional focus is tied to IFRS 9\u2019s role as the accounting standard for financial instruments: IFRS 9 set new accounting rules for financial instruments and replaced IAS 39, and it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (after EU endorsement). [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1] So, for firms using the transition, the PRA\u2019s capital-buffer judgement can reflect both the usual capital/risk indicators and the specific IFRS 9 transitional assessment through end-2023, in the context of IFRS 9\u2019s post-2018 replacement of IAS 39.

[#TGT:5b56ca243fc390af] Accordingly, the institution should (i) identify whether its contribution was made as cash paid in or as assets delivered and, if assets were delivered, use their market value, and (ii) subtract any amount of that same contribution that has already been applied by the QCCP to cover losses in the specified default scenario.

    "gold_answer": "In deciding whether a firm should hold a larger buffer or strengthen its capital position, the PRA\u2019s assessment can include both general capital/risk factors and, for a limited period, an additional lens tied to IFRS 9 transitional arrangements. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] Specifically, the PRA expects firms to increase buffers or strengthen capital where needed based on factors such as the firm\u2019s leverage ratio, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, risks from double leverage, and the extent to which potentially significant risks are not fully captured in the stress test. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] Alongside those factors, until the end of 2023 the PRA will also assess firms\u2019 capital positions under transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 where firms are using those arrangements. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] This transitional-assessment element relates to IFRS 9 as the accounting framework for financial instruments: IFRS 9 introduced new accounting rules for financial instruments and replaced the prior rules in IAS 39, and it became effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (following EU endorsement).

    "gold_answer": "To calculate exposure for each asset description, the firm must first assign a value to that asset description using the amount determined under this Part\u2019s valuation rules, or\u2014if there is no valuation provision for that asset description\u2014using an amount that would reasonably be paid for an immediate assignment or transfer.

    "gold_answer": "A firm should treat changes in its own credit standing as irrelevant for any valuation adjustment after the liability has been initially recognised, and this approach aligns with the specific rule that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking must not apply a valuation adjustment for changes in its own credit standing. [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6] In scope, the firm\u2019s obligation applies to financial liabilities that are valued under UK-adopted international accounting standards, and the valuation at the point of initial recognition must follow the referenced \u201c5\u201d requirement. [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6] After that initial recognition point, the firm is prohibited from making later valuation changes that reflect its own credit standing moving up or down. [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6] This is consistent with the Valuation 10.1 statement that there is to be no valuation adjustment that takes account of a change in the own credit standing of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. [#SRC:d6c3553c96db7f71] Read together, the combined effect is that, whether framed as a general firm requirement for financial liabilities post-initial recognition or as the Valuation 10.1 rule for an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, own-credit movements are not a permitted driver of valuation adjustments.

    "gold_answer": "To use an intragroup loan as an asset backing TPs, the firm needs to be able to show that the asset is invested in a way that matches the nature and duration of the firm\u2019s insurance and reinsurance liabilities and that it is in the best interests of all policyholders, while also considering any disclosed policy objectives. [#SRC:afb7633ef682266c] The PRA highlights that intragroup loans (and similar participations or arrangements) can be problematic under this standard because they may benefit shareholders without necessarily benefiting policyholders. [#TGT:19e81bc332eae024] The PRA also notes a specific risk: the issuer of the loan may be less willing or able to enforce repayment, particularly for upstream loans, which can undermine the case that the arrangement protects policyholders\u2019 interests. [#TGT:19e81bc332eae024] Because of these concerns, the PRA expects there is a high hurdle for firms to demonstrate that intragroup loans and participations are in policyholders\u2019 best interests, and therefore a high hurdle to demonstrate they are appropriate for covering TPs. [#TGT:19e81bc332eae024] This means the firm\u2019s explanation must satisfy both the general investment standard for TP-backing assets and the PRA\u2019s heightened scrutiny for intragroup transactions.

    "question": "If a firm is allowed to use a partial or full internal model, what does it have to send the PRA every quarter about model changes, and which template and instructions tell it what to include (including qualitative support)?",
    "gold_answer": "If a firm has permission to use a partial or full internal model, it has to send the PRA a quarterly update about changes to that model. [#SRC:6b80f0d656b136bd] The quarterly update must be a summary that covers both minor and major model changes, and it is required under Article 6(3) of Chapter 2A of the Reporting Part of the PRA Rulebook together with the EIOPA Guidelines on the use of internal models. [#SRC:6b80f0d656b136bd] To provide the information in the required reporting format, firms using an internal model must submit quarterly template QMC.01 in Chapter 9. [#TGT:96395cb1453e2aa2] That template is used to specify information on model changes and to include supporting qualitative information, so the quarterly summary is not just a list of changes but also includes qualitative support. [#TGT:96395cb1453e2aa2] The firm must also follow the instructions in section QMC.01 of Chapter 10, which sets out how to complete the template and what information to provide. [#TGT:96395cb1453e2aa2] In practice, the firm meets the quarterly summary requirement by completing and submitting QMC.01 with the required model-change details and qualitative support to the PRA each quarter.

    "question": "If the C17.01/C17.02 reporting instructions tell you to use supervisory disclosures from the EBA website, what UK document should you use instead, and where do you find it online?",
    "gold_answer": "You should treat the instruction to use supervisory disclosures from the EBA website as meaning you must use the corresponding disclosure produced by the PRA for those COREP templates. [#SRC:40ad42a86de28e1d] The online location for that PRA disclosure is the \u201cRegulatory reporting \u2013 banking sector\u201d page in the prudential regulation section of the Bank of England website, using the specific web address provided. [#TGT:91473ca52a070954] This linkage matters because the COREP instructions for C17.01 and C17.02 explicitly redirect certain non-UK references (including the EBA supervisory disclosure reference) to UK equivalents, so your reporting should be based on the PRA-produced disclosure rather than the EBA publication. [#SRC:40ad42a86de28e1d] In other words, when you see the EBA supervisory disclosure reference in those instructions, you should navigate to the Bank of England prudential regulation area and retrieve the PRA disclosure from the Regulatory reporting \u2013 banking sector page, ensuring your template completion uses the UK-referenced source.

    "question": "If a firm is setting up its risk-management system, what does it need to cover so it both (a) includes risks used for the SCR and risks not fully captured there, and (b) meets the requirement that calibration takes account of all quantifiable risks (including the listed minimum risk types)?",
    "gold_answer": "The firm needs a risk-management system that is broad enough to cover the risks used in the SCR calculation and also any risks that are not, or not fully, included in that calculation, while also aligning with the calibration expectation that all quantifiable risks the firm faces are taken into account. [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876] [#TGT:f261181a95a3ca51] The system must be effective and properly integrated into the firm\u2019s organisational structure and decision-making processes, with proper consideration of the persons who have key functions, so that the calibration and risk coverage are embedded in how the firm is run. [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876] To make this concrete, the calibration requirement says quantifiable risks must be captured and names at least non-life underwriting risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk, market risk, credit risk, and operational risk. [#TGT:f261181a95a3ca51] The risk-management system must also cover at least these areas: underwriting and reserving; asset-liability management; investment risk management (especially derivatives, quasi-derivatives and similar commitments); liquidity risk and concentration risk management; operational risk management; and reinsurance and other risk-mitigation techniques. [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876] Putting these together, the firm should ensure its listed risk-management areas are used to identify and manage the minimum risk categories and any other quantifiable risks, including those not fully reflected in the SCR calculation.

[#ID:ec68cf68d094e876] Separately, the SCR calibration must be designed so that all quantifiable risks the firm is exposed to are taken into account, including at least non-life, life and health underwriting risks, market risk, credit risk, and operational risk. [#ID:f261181a95a3ca51] Where the SCR is calibrated to only a subset of identified risks (eg due to mitigation), the firm should clearly justify exclusions and allow for secondary risks created by mitigation.

    "gold_answer": "The text says that all non-executive directors who are members of the management body\u2014whether independent or not\u2014have a binding obligation to act with honesty, integrity, and independence of mind. [#SRC:8e63907640d17c50] It also clarifies that \u201cindependence of mind\u201d is not just a label but a pattern of behaviour that shows up especially during board discussions and decision-making, where each board member should be able to reach sound, objective, and independent decisions and judgements. [#SRC:8e63907640d17c50] Alongside that, the same passage ties these expectations to specified internal conduct requirements by stating that non-executive directors are required under Rules 2.1\u20132.3 and 3.4 in the Conduct Rules Part of the Rulebook to act with integrity, due skill, care and diligence, and to be open and co-operative with regulators.
