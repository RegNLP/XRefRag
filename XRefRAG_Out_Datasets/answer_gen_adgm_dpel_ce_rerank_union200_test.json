    "question": "If an Authorised Person is using the FCCA, what kinds of assets count as eligible financial Collateral, and what extra step must the Authorised Person take before they can recognise the effects of CRM for that Collateral?",
    "gold_answer": "For an Authorised Person using the FCCA, eligible financial Collateral is limited to specific categories, and recognising the effects of CRM for those Collateral types requires meeting an additional compliance condition. [#TGT:2d7f3106-4761-4113-abe3-580e52ee1c85] The eligible categories are: any instrument listed in Rule 4.13.5; any equity Security (including a convertible bond) that is traded on a regulated exchange; and Units in a Collective Investment Fund that invests in those traded equity Securities, but only where the Unit price is publicly quoted daily and at least 90% of the Fund\u2019s deposited property is invested in instruments listed in this Rule and Rule 4.13.5. [#TGT:2d7f3106-4761-4113-abe3-580e52ee1c85] Separately, to recognise the effects of CRM for Collateral types covered by Rules 4.13.5 to 4.13.7, the Authorised Person must ensure the relevant requirements in Rule 4.13.8 are complied with.

    "gold_answer": "In the period after the Rule 3.1.2 notification and before Promotion begins in a Host Jurisdiction, the Fund Manager must act quickly: once it becomes aware of a material change, error, or omission that is reasonably likely to matter to that notification, it must send written notice to the Regulator without delay.

    "gold_answer": "Yes\u2014there are two related contracting options, and the second one depends on the Payment Service User not being a Natural Person.

[#TGT:d95a8aaf-4663-4372-87b7-54040b62f0ba] For an ADGM Branch, those Resolution Conditions include that the Regulator is satisfied the branch is failing or likely to fail, that (considering timing and other relevant circumstances) it is not reasonably likely that other action by or in respect of the ADGM Branch or the Non-ADGM Institution will prevent that failure or likely failure, and that applying a Resolution Tool is in the public interest.

    "gold_answer": "For an Authorised Person seeking to amend an existing Financial Services Permission to add one or more additional Regulated Activities, the fee outcome is determined by combining (i) the obligation to pay the applicable application fees for the additional Regulated Activities and (ii) the method for calculating the total when multiple Regulated Activities are applied for at the same time. The Authorised Person must pay the Regulator the application fees for the additional Regulated Activities as set out in Rule 3.2.1.

[#TGT:4797c128-c19a-4af6-89ba-59fb6b9ac4d2] Practically, this means the Rule 3.2.1 fee schedule supplies the relevant per-activity fees, while the multi-activity rule determines that the payable amount is anchored by the highest applicable fee plus capped incremental fees for each additional activity in the same submission.

    "gold_answer": "For the Countercyclical Capital Buffer calculation, the Authorised Person must treat the jurisdiction of a private sector credit exposure as the place where the underlying credit risk ultimately originates, based on the best identification it can make. [#TGT:ffc672ed-a781-4a71-bb0d-7fc38a2e0c7c] That jurisdiction identification matters because the buffer is calculated by taking the Authorised Person\u2019s Total Risk Exposure Amount and multiplying it by a weighted average of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates that apply to exposures in the jurisdictions where those private sector credit exposures are located. [#SRC:61013be0-a186-4ad3-9c9e-4fe2164b5b2c] In other words, the \u201clocation\u201d step determines which jurisdictional buffer rates are considered \u201capplicable\u201d for the weighted average, and the weighted average then directly drives the size of the buffer when applied to the Total Risk Exposure Amount. [#SRC:61013be0-a186-4ad3-9c9e-4fe2164b5b2c] The Authorised Person must therefore link each exposure to a jurisdiction by tracing the ultimate origin of the credit risk, and then use those jurisdictions\u2019 rates in the weighted-average component of the buffer formula.

    "generated_answer": "For Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) purposes, the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d for each private sector credit exposure is the jurisdiction where that exposure is located, and the CCyB rate applied is the rate applicable to that jurisdiction.

[#SRC:72e47a23-5aa5-4df1-a4d6-2aaf037e9131] Accordingly, the Business Rules should not just state the general trading-quality requirement; they should be applied through an admission review that explicitly checks those closed-ended fund factors so the Recognised Investment Exchange can conclude the Units will trade fairly, orderly and efficiently on its market.

    "question": "When assessing potential contravention of section 92(2) (Insider Dealing), how should a firm distinguish between (i) a person merely executing their own pre-formed intention to deal and (ii) dealing on the basis of \u201cInside Information\u201d for Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, or Accepted Spot Commodities (including Related Instruments that are not Commodity Derivatives)?",
    "gold_answer": "A person\u2019s execution of their own pre-formed intention to deal, by itself, is treated as not breaching section 92(2) (Insider Dealing); the compliance focus therefore shifts to whether the dealing is instead connected to \u201cInside Information\u201d as defined for the relevant instruments. [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] For Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, Accepted Spot Commodities, and Related Instruments that are not Commodity Derivatives, \u201cInside Information\u201d is limited to information that is precise, not generally available, and that relates (directly or indirectly) to one or more Reporting Entities or Issuers or to the instruments themselves, and that would likely move the price significantly if it became generally available. [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] In practical terms, the firm should (1) confirm the person formed an intention to deal before dealing and recognize that carrying out that intention alone is not the contravention trigger, [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] and (2) separately test whether any information influencing the trade meets all elements of the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition (precise, non-public, relevant to Reporting Entities/Issuers or the instruments, and price-significant). [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] This linkage matters because the \u201cown intention\u201d concept addresses the act of dealing, while the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition supplies the characteristics of information that could make dealing problematic under an insider dealing analysis. [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977]",

[#ID:3a36cf08-390a-4806-9815-6e20f42fd0c8] Dealing \u201con the basis of\u201d Inside Information includes using non-public issuer or transaction information to buy/sell Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, or Accepted Spot Commodities, or to gain an unfair advantage, and can extend to dealing in Related Instruments (including those providing only economic exposure).

[#TGT:d95a8aaf-4663-4372-87b7-54040b62f0ba] Therefore, the Regulator can proceed with ADGM Branch Resolution Action only if the ADGM-Branch conditions are met, while it can simultaneously decline recognition if the foreign action would disadvantage ADGM creditors compared with non-ADGM creditors.
