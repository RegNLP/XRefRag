Practically, the firm should ensure its identification is complete relative to its own determinations—if the firm considers multiple functions to be key, the identification should cover all of them, not only the most obvious ones.

In practice, the plan should be forward-looking and timed so that capital is secured before pressures materialise, rather than reacting when buffers are already at risk. It should also support the bank’s stated path to profitability, recognising that prolonged unprofitability increases uncertainty about continued positive investor sentiment, and that delayed capital raising can distract management at critical moments.

Banks should focus on reaching profitability and the ability to achieve organic capital generation within a reasonable time period following authorisation, recognising that the longer they are unprofitable, the more uncertainty there is about whether investor sentiment will remain positive. By around three years post-authorisation, the PRA expects banks to have more clarity over their path to profitability. By five years post-authorisation, banks should either be profitable or have a credible strategy to achieve profitability, with definite capital support to achieve this. If the firm is of a size to require minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) at greater than minimum capital requirements within this planning horizon, it needs to factor in those requirements (see paragraph 4.4 ). The PRA, however, recognises that a number of factors, including the nature of the business model, could impact the path to profitability, and will apply flexibility in exceptional circumstances where the path to profitability is credible and there is sufficient financial resources in place in advance to manage the risks around that path. At least until profitability is achieved, the PRA expects firms to have a credible capital plan which will ensure new capital is injected in good time to avoid capital requirements plus buffers being entered.

During that six-month protection period, the compensation payable is generally limited by a maximum compensation sum for a temporary high balance of £1,400,000, which is also stated to be subject to the same condition [#TGT:b5fbb2a524d9ce87]. There is, however, a specific exception to the cap: where the temporary high balance arises from a payment in connection with personal injury or incapacity, no limit applies to the compensation payable, meaning the £1,400,000 maximum does not restrict compensation for that category even within the same six-month protection window [#TGT:b5fbb2a524d9ce87]. In practice, you must therefore apply the six-month protection period and then determine whether the general £1,400,000 cap applies or whether the personal injury/incapacity exception removes the cap, while recognizing that both the duration and the cap framework are stated as conditional on the referenced “subject to” provision [#SRC:c5681afe59b6da5a] [#TGT:b5fbb2a524d9ce87].", "source_text": "The protection for temporary high balances under 4.3 shall, subject to 4.4 , run for a period of six months from the later of:", "target_text": "Subject to 4.4 , the maximum compensation sum payable for a temporary high balance is £1,400,000, save that no limit shall apply to the compensation payable for a temporary high balance arising from a payment in connection with personal injury or incapacity.", "source_passage_id": "c5681afe59b6da5a", "target_passage_id": "b5fbb2a524d9ce87", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic"}
{"item_id": "d72ecad8bd30187f", "question": "When a credit union invests its surplus funds, what documentation must it create to evidence that it has considered and recorded its investment decision (including the relevant risk factors), and for how long must that written assessment record be retained after the investment date?", "gold_answer": "When a credit union invests its surplus funds, it is required to consider and document its investment decisions, including accounting for counterparty, concentration, liquidity, and interest rate risk, and to make decisions that reflect the credit union’s risk appetite and the risk/return trade-off [#SRC:b0d16647ea0d1e00]. In addition to creating that documented assessment, the credit union must keep a written record of the relevant assessment and retain it for five years following the date of the investment [#TGT:9a674e73f8cecd3e]. Read together, the Source establishes the substance of what the credit union is expected to consider and record when making the investment decision (the decision rationale and key risk dimensions), while the Target sets a clear retention period tied to the investment date for the written record of that assessment. This means the credit union should ensure its documentation is sufficiently complete to demonstrate that the required risks were considered and that the decision aligns with its risk appetite, and then maintain that written record for the full five-year period after the investment is made.", "source_text": "Credit unions investing their surplus funds are required to consider and document their decisions and account for counterparty, concentration, liquidity, and interest rate risk under Rules 6.5 and 6.6 of the Credit Unions Part of the PRA Rulebook. When making investment decisions, the PRA expects credit unions to carefully consider the risk return trade-off and to ensure investment decisions reflect the credit union’s risk appetite. Credit unions should consider setting exposure limits for different counterparties based on their risk profile, as part of their risk appetite statement.", "target_text": "A credit union must retain, for a period of five years following the date of the investment, a written record of the assessment in 6.5 .", "source_passage_id": "b0d16647ea0d1e00", "target_passage_id": "9a674e73f8cecd3e", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional"}
{"item_id": "a6bc54c81be0fc17", "question": "For a composite firm that carries on both long-term insurance business and general insurance business, what accounts must it maintain so that it can prepare the required statement on the basis of those accounts, and what must that statement identify in relation to the notional MCRs for each business?", "gold_answer": "A composite firm must first maintain separate accounts for each of its long-term insurance business and its general insurance business, so that the sources of the results for each activity are shown separately [#TGT:eac60971cab72fc0]. Those separate accounts then form the basis on which the firm must prepare a statement [#SRC:0b09948a10ceade3]. Using that accounts-based foundation, the statement must identify the eligible own funds that cover the notional long-term insurance MCR and, separately, the eligible own funds that cover the notional general insurance MCR [#SRC:0b09948a10ceade3]. Read together, the obligations require a clear separation of accounting information by business line (long-term versus general) and a corresponding, accounts-supported identification in the statement of which eligible own funds are attributed to covering each notional MCR. This linkage ensures the statement is prepared on an appropriate evidential basis (the separate accounts) and that the identification of coverage is made distinctly for each of the two notional MCRs, rather than on a combined or undifferentiated basis.", "source_text": "The firm must prepare a statement on the basis of the accounts referred to in 3.2 identifying the eligible own funds covering the notional long-term insurance MCR and the notional general insurance MCR , respectively.", "target_text": "A composite firm must maintain separate accounts for each of its long-term insurance business and its general insurance business to show the sources of the results for each activity separately.", "source_passage_id": "0b09948a10ceade3", "target_passage_id": "eac60971cab72fc0", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional"}
