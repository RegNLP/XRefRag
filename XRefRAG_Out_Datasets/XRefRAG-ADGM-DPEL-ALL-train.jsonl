{"item_id": "7402a6b0fd57146f", "question": "If a Petroleum Reporting Entity is putting together its Summary of Reserves and Resources, what table does it normally need to add and how recent must the table’s “as of” date be, and does that still apply if it files SEC compliant Forms 10-K and 20-F Reports every year?", "gold_answer": "Normally, a Petroleum Reporting Entity must add a table to its Summary of Reserves and Resources using the MKT Form 12-1 format. [#SRC:cd137cde-9ef8-4ed1-a401-6bf47f8ccb04] The table must be dated “as of” a point in time that is not more than one month before the Summary of Reserves and Resources is disclosed, meaning the “as of” date cannot be earlier than one month prior to that disclosure. [#SRC:cd137cde-9ef8-4ed1-a401-6bf47f8ccb04] But this requirement does not apply in the same way to every Petroleum Reporting Entity: if the entity is required to file SEC compliant Forms 10-K and 20-F Reports annually with the SEC, it does not have to comply with Rule 12.14.1. [#TGT:b249219a-57ec-4b15-be46-58475357c6c1] Because the MKT Form 12-1 table and its one-month “as of” date condition are part of Rule 12.14.1, an entity in that SEC annual filing category is not required to follow that table-and-date requirement under Rule 12.14.1, while an entity outside that category must follow it when preparing the Summary of Reserves and Resources.
