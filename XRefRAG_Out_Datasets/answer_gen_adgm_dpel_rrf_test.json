    "gold_answer": "For an Offer involving Units, the combined effect is that the Chapter\u2019s provisions (and Rules made for that Chapter) do not apply to the person making the Offer, and the Rulebook\u2019s chapter 4 Prospectus content and structure requirements are also not applicable to Prospectuses relating to Units of Funds.

[#SRC:254251bf-b846-4357-af1b-961bfa5fff94] Instead, the Prospectus requirements that do apply to an Offer of Units of Funds are located in the Fund Rules, which are identified as the source of applicable Prospectus requirements for such Offers. [#SRC:254251bf-b846-4357-af1b-961bfa5fff94] This allocation is reinforced by the statement that Section 57(1) of FSMR disapplies chapter 4 of the Rulebook to Fund Prospectuses, aligning the Rulebook\u2019s chapter 4 non-application for Units of Funds with the broader non-application framework for the Chapter in relation to making an Offer of a Unit.

[#SRC:596309d5-cc1a-4a45-9e6d-2042ff11da76] The notification trigger occurs when Capital Resources fall below 120% of the Capital Requirement (meaning the 120% test is applied to the Capital Requirement figure that includes the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum component).

[#SRC:596309d5-cc1a-4a45-9e6d-2042ff11da76] Put together, the compliance steps are: compute the Capital Requirement under Section 3.6 (including the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum), monitor Capital Resources against 120% of that amount, and if the firm falls below, notify immediately and follow up with written confirmation.

    "gold_answer": "For an Authorised Person using the FCCA, eligible financial Collateral is limited to specific categories, and recognising the effects of CRM for those Collateral types requires meeting an additional compliance condition. [#TGT:2d7f3106-4761-4113-abe3-580e52ee1c85] The eligible categories are: any instrument listed in Rule 4.13.5; any equity Security (including a convertible bond) that is traded on a regulated exchange; and Units in a Collective Investment Fund that invests in those traded equity Securities, but only where the Unit price is publicly quoted daily and at least 90% of the Fund\u2019s deposited property is invested in instruments listed in this Rule and Rule 4.13.5.

[#SRC:c36bf3cf-160f-43ab-bb40-9d7f5ceec7b8] Putting these together, even if an asset fits one of the FCCA eligible Collateral categories (including the Fund Unit category with its daily pricing and 90% investment threshold), the Authorised Person still needs to satisfy Rule 4.13.8 before CRM recognition is available for the relevant Collateral type.

    "gold_answer": "A Reporting Entity must ensure it has an auditor and that the appointment is made through the specific framework referenced for auditor appointments. [#TGT:74fee9ec-688d-43df-99e1-bc5b4f83f0fb] The baseline obligation is that the Reporting Entity is required to appoint an auditor under section 82 of the FSMR, so the entity cannot omit making an appointment. [#SRC:0b00ca08-6924-419e-b76d-dd66e5575a33] In addition, the appointment is not merely a general designation; it must be carried out in accordance with Part 15 and any Rules made for the purposes of that Part, meaning the Reporting Entity must follow that Part 15/Rules pathway when appointing the auditor. [#TGT:74fee9ec-688d-43df-99e1-bc5b4f83f0fb] Read together, section 82 establishes the duty to appoint, while the Part 15 and related Rules condition specifies the required method or procedural basis for how the auditor is appointed.

    "gold_answer": "For an Authorised Person seeking to amend an existing Financial Services Permission to add one or more additional Regulated Activities, the fee outcome is determined by combining (i) the obligation to pay the applicable application fees for the additional Regulated Activities and (ii) the method for calculating the total when multiple Regulated Activities are applied for at the same time.

[#TGT:4797c128-c19a-4af6-89ba-59fb6b9ac4d2] Practically, this means the Rule 3.2.1 fee schedule supplies the relevant per-activity fees, while the multi-activity rule determines that the payable amount is anchored by the highest applicable fee plus capped incremental fees for each additional activity in the same submission.

[#SRC:61013be0-a186-4ad3-9c9e-4fe2164b5b2c] In other words, the \u201clocation\u201d step determines which jurisdictional buffer rates are considered \u201capplicable\u201d for the weighted average, and the weighted average then directly drives the size of the buffer when applied to the Total Risk Exposure Amount.

    "gold_answer": "A person\u2019s execution of their own pre-formed intention to deal, by itself, is treated as not breaching section 92(2) (Insider Dealing); the compliance focus therefore shifts to whether the dealing is instead connected to \u201cInside Information\u201d as defined for the relevant instruments. [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] For Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, Accepted Spot Commodities, and Related Instruments that are not Commodity Derivatives, \u201cInside Information\u201d is limited to information that is precise, not generally available, and that relates (directly or indirectly) to one or more Reporting Entities or Issuers or to the instruments themselves, and that would likely move the price significantly if it became generally available. [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] In practical terms, the firm should (1) confirm the person formed an intention to deal before dealing and recognize that carrying out that intention alone is not the contravention trigger, [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] and (2) separately test whether any information influencing the trade meets all elements of the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition (precise, non-public, relevant to Reporting Entities/Issuers or the instruments, and price-significant). [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] This linkage matters because the \u201cown intention\u201d concept addresses the act of dealing, while the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition supplies the characteristics of information that could make dealing problematic under an insider dealing analysis.
