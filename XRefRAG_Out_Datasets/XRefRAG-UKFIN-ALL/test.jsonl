Beyond being a required enclosure, the PRA says it would find it helpful if the scrutineers report also contains additional explanatory content when relevant: it should describe any procedural difficulties encountered in running the voting process and provide an analysis of the reasons votes were treated as invalid, but particularly where the number of invalid votes appears to be significant [#TGT:2c0f6dd7f7e57586].

The TARGET then tells you where those PRA approach documents are available online by giving a specific Bank of England link to the PRA approach documents page [#TGT:e887f801375d7abb]. Putting both together, you can describe the PRA’s non-rules supervisory materials as supervisory approach documents (including SoPs and SSs) and you can point to the exact online location where the PRA makes its approach documents available. This combined view supports a practical compliance step: when tracking PRA expectations, you should monitor not only PRA rules but also the PRA’s supervisory approach documents, and you can use the provided URL as the reference point for accessing those materials [#SRC:e2d2b8440b248841] [#TGT:e887f801375d7abb].", "source_text": "Alongside PRA rules, the PRA also issues supervisory approach documents, 1 SoPs, 2 and SSs. 3", "target_text": "1.

To apply that scope correctly, you need to identify what the instrument is: “Permanent interest-bearing shares” are defined as “a type of deferred share” [#TGT:91aeec4ad31299e3]. That definition matters because it tells you that Permanent interest-bearing shares are a share type (deferred share) and therefore sit naturally within the “share” side of the listed scope, rather than being treated as CCDS or PPDS [#SRC:3bbbda00879e9203]. So, if the integration work changes the product terms attached to Permanent interest-bearing shares (as deferred shares), those changes should be treated as changes to the terms and conditions in the same way as changes to CCDS, PPDS, “PIBS 26,” and other share and deposit account terms [#SRC:3bbbda00879e9203] [#TGT:91aeec4ad31299e3].", "source_text": "(a) any changes to the terms and conditions of CCDS, PPDS, PIBS 26 and share and deposit accounts, including the integration of the product lines of the transferor society(ies) into those of the transferee or successor society;", "target_text": "26.

This is because the MA’s impact on technical provisions is part of the relevant elements that are within the required scope of audit. In doing this, auditors should take into account that the MA calculation depends in part on applying MA calculation requirements, and that the scale of the MA could be affected if the assets and liabilities used to calculate the MA were not within scope of an MA permission. So, for a firm in scope of the Chapter, auditors should consider both the claimed MA amount and whether the inputs used to calculate it sit within the permission boundary, since that boundary can change the scale being claimed.", "source_text": "However, to provide the audit opinion required in relation to the SFCR, to the extent it is material to their opinion, auditors are expected to consider the scale of the MA claimed by the firm.

The MA calculation depends in part on the application of the MA calculation requirements (set out including in regulations 5 and 6 of the IRPR regulations and Chapters 4 , 6 and 8 of the Matching Adjustment Part ).
