    "gold_answer": "The PRA\u2019s expectation that a firm should limit its investment appropriately where there is insufficient data to quantify the risks arises when the firm is considering the nature and quantification of risks for each category of asset and for individual assets [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8]. However, the scope of the relevant part of the chapter is restricted for firms investing in assets that cover technical provisions (TPs) for linked long-term contracts of insurance: those provisions do not apply to such firms, except in a specific carve-in [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. The carve-in is where the assets are held to cover the additional TPs in respect of policyholder liabilities, including liabilities for any guarantee of investment performance or other guaranteed benefit provided under those linked long-term contracts [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. Accordingly, the firm should treat the expectation to limit investment due to insufficient risk data as applicable when the assets fall within that exception (ie, held for additional TPs tied to policyholder liabilities and guarantees), and as not applicable under this chapter where the assets merely cover TPs for linked long-term contracts without meeting the exception [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6] [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8].",

    "question": "If a credit union is expected by the PRA to follow concentration limits because it is over \u00a310 million in assets or holds certain investments, do those limits still apply when money is only sitting in an account for a short time before an investment decision is made?",
    "gold_answer": "Reading the two statements together, the PRA sets an expectation that certain credit unions should adhere to concentration limits: specifically, credit unions with more than \u00a310 million in total assets and any credit unions that hold investments that fall under the referenced Rules, with an additional note that there are exceptions for certain listed investments. At the same time, the PRA also explains that the limits are not intended to apply in a particular, narrow situation\u2014where funds are held temporarily in an account before an investment decision is made. So, even if a credit union is within the group the PRA expects to follow the concentration limits, it can treat those limits as not applying to money that is merely parked on a short-term basis while the credit union has not yet decided how to invest it. The key boundary is the purpose and timing of the holding: the carve-out is tied to pre-decision, temporary holding, whereas the expectation to adhere to concentration limits is directed at credit unions meeting the asset-size or investment-holding conditions, subject to the separate investment exceptions.

    "gold_answer": "Where Institutions choose to calculate exposure values for derivative positions using a particular method, they have a notification duty: they shall notify the competent authorities of the methods they use, or cease to use, to calculate the exposure value of their derivative positions [#SRC:7085c26bac1b91bb]. That obligation applies alongside the permission in the netting context: Institutions may calculate a single exposure value for all transactions within a contractual netting agreement only where the specified conditions are met; if those conditions are not met, Institutions must instead calculate an exposure value separately for each transaction, treating each transaction as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Practically, this means that whenever an Institution adopts (or stops using) a method to support either (i) a single exposure value approach for transactions within a contractual netting agreement, or (ii) separate exposure value calculations per transaction, it must notify the competent authorities of the relevant method change or continued use. The notification requirement is framed around the methods used to calculate exposure values, not around the netting permission itself, so Institutions should ensure their notifications align with the method(s) actually applied to the exposure value calculations in either scenario.",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The TARGET sets a two-step requirement for a firm: it must value financial liabilities (as referred to in UK-adopted international accounting standards) in the required way when the liability is first recognised, and then it must not make any later adjustment that takes account of a change in the firm\u2019s own credit standing after that initial recognition [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6]. The SOURCE expresses the same type of restriction for a different actor and in a \u201csubsequently\u201d context: it states that there shall be no valuation adjustment to take account of the change in own credit standing of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking [#SRC:d6c3553c96db7f71]. Taken together, the practical rule is consistent across both texts: once the liability valuation is established at the relevant recognition point, later movements in the entity\u2019s own credit standing are not a permitted reason to adjust the valuation. The main difference is only who is being addressed (a firm versus an insurance or reinsurance undertaking) and the explicit linkage in the TARGET to initial recognition and subsequent adjustments.",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. Even if there are amounts that the FSCS has not been able to recover from DGS members as a result of the relevant levy outcomes described in the source, the FSCS is still constrained by the rule that sets a maximum annual amount of DGS compensation costs it can levy on DGS members [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380]. Specifically, the FSCS must not set the maximum amount of DGS compensation costs for which it can levy DGS members per calendar year above 0.5% of total covered deposits (excluding temporary high balances) of all DGS members [#TGT:ba641d05400bc860]. The unrecovered-amounts situation explains that some sums may remain unpaid or uncollected from DGS members, but it does not itself authorize the FSCS to exceed the cap [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380]. The only stated way the FSCS can levy more than the cap is if there are exceptional circumstances and the FSCS has the prior consent of the PRA; without that consent (and without exceptional circumstances), charging above the cap is prohibited [#TGT:ba641d05400bc860].",

    "gold_answer": "To apply the PRA\u2019s expectation for branches regarding the level of FSCS-covered retail and small company instant access deposit balances, the firm must first classify which account balances qualify as being in an \u201cinstant access account,\u201d because the expectation is specifically framed around \u201cFSCS covered instant access deposits\u201d held at branches and kept under the stated threshold [#SRC:5ad52e36aa024bad].

Accordingly, when assessing whether branch-held retail and small company balances fall within the scope of the PRA\u2019s expectation, the firm should treat balances as \u201cinstant access\u201d only where the account terms and actual customer access allow unconditional withdrawals with no notice requirement and no penalty.

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The reduction is required to be carried out by making a deduction from the aggregate value of the assets that the firm would otherwise be permitted to take into account for the relevant purposes. That tells you how the firm must apply the reduction in practice: it is taken off the asset total that would otherwise be counted, rather than being handled as a separate adjustment outside the aggregate asset value. At the same time, the firm\u2019s aggregate value of assets must be reduced by an amount that represents the aggregate of specified components, and that obligation applies subject to the related provisions that frame how the reduction operates. Putting both requirements together, the firm must first identify the reduction amount as the aggregate of the relevant items, and then implement that reduction by deducting that amount from the aggregate asset value it would otherwise be allowed to include. This ensures the reduction is both correctly calculated and correctly applied to the asset base [#TGT:f960c6353f214378] and [#SRC:583731155e8d0cf1].",

    "gold_answer": "The definition operates in two linked steps that must be read together. Ordinarily, the minimum guarantee fund for long-term insurance business is determined by selecting the amount shown in column 2 of the relevant table, matched to the firm\u2019s highest annual contribution income for that business in any preceding financial year (with the income band identified in column 1) [#SRC:7add590aa50e6993]. However, that table-based approach depends on the existence of a preceding financial year from which the firm\u2019s highest annual contribution income can be identified. Where the firm has not been in existence long enough to have a preceding financial year, the definition provides a specific substitute amount: the minimum guarantee fund for long-term insurance business is set at \u00a390,000 [#TGT:57922715d15fab69]. In practice, this means a newly established firm (or one without a completed preceding financial year) does not attempt to infer or approximate a \u201chighest annual contribution income\u201d for table selection; instead, it applies the fixed \u00a390,000 minimum guarantee fund until it has a preceding financial year that enables the standard table correspondence to be used.",

    "gold_answer": "You need to apply two separate percentage limits that address different scopes, and both can matter for the same set of exposures.

    "gold_answer": "The proxy voting forms that may be included as \u201cother documents\u201d alongside a covering letter for the Merger Document(s) are not just generic voting papers; they are the formal instrument used to appoint a proxy. Their purpose is to let a member name someone else to attend a meeting of a society and vote for the member. So, in the merger materials package, the covering letter is an accompanying document, and the proxy voting forms are the mechanism that enables members who cannot attend to still participate through a proxy\u2019s attendance and voting. This connection matters because the source indicates that proxy voting forms can be part of the documents provided with the Merger Document(s) [#SRC:81e3009351497661], and the target clarifies the meaning and function of that proxy instrument: it appoints a proxy to attend the society meeting and vote on the member\u2019s behalf [#TGT:075179a0e3b09cfe].",

[#ID:cdeb5d3fcecd64a7] Although societies are generally not required to include proxy forms with meeting notices, the PRA considers it good practice to send them for a merger to avoid any perception that members were discouraged from voting or had to request forms.

So, directors should ensure the credit union (1) identifies the correct provision level right before the loan is rescheduled or arrears are capitalised, and (2) does not reduce that provision during the following period, only allowing a change after the loan has performed for the full six months required [#TGT:bbe5b9ddbc2430ff], as part of accurate compliance oversight [#SRC:837cf352ecff942f].",

Alongside this, the firm must detail and explain the dependencies between recovery options and clearly identify where recovery options are mutually exclusive, so it is transparent which options rely on others and which options cannot be pursued at the same time [#SRC:21e8b786b13431f6]. In practice, the plan should therefore link the coverage of each relevant group entity (including those in other jurisdictions) with a clear explanation of how recovery options interact, so that the overall recovery approach is internally consistent and any constraints created by group-wide dependencies are explicitly set out [#SRC:21e8b786b13431f6] [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41].",

    "gold_answer": "The institution\u2019s starting point is that it has a time\u2011bound obligation to stop calculating exposure values for its derivative positions under the specified calculation approach within six months after a relevant trigger occurs [#SRC:e840f5f94a52b4e7]. Separately, the framework permits institutions to calculate one combined exposure value for all transactions covered by a contractual netting agreement, but only where all the stated conditions for that netting treatment are met [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. If those netting conditions are not met, the institution is not permitted to aggregate and instead must calculate an exposure value for each transaction on a standalone basis, with each transaction treated as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Read together, the permission to use a single exposure value under qualifying contractual netting does not remove or extend the separate requirement to cease the specified exposure\u2011value calculation method within the six\u2011month window; rather, it governs how exposure values may be determined (single netted value versus separate transaction values) in the circumstances where exposure values are being calculated [#SRC:e840f5f94a52b4e7] [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c].",

    "gold_answer": "The credit union\u2019s compliance check must combine the TARGET obligation with the SOURCE counting rule. Under the TARGET, Subject to 2.3 and 2.4, a credit union must ensure that a member does not have non-deferred shares in the credit union which in aggregate exceed the greater of the applicable limit.

    "question": "When identity verification has not been completed under the relevant anti-money laundering requirements before the firm\u2019s compensation date, how should insolvency practitioners align their required consideration of their objectives and responsibilities with the ability for the relevant insolvency practitioner appointed by the court to facilitate identity verification to determine eligibility for FSCS protection?",
    "gold_answer": "Where identity verification has not been carried out in accordance with the relevant anti-money laundering requirements ahead of the firm\u2019s compensation date, the PRA\u2019s view is that the relevant insolvency practitioner appointed by the court is permitted to facilitate the identity verification specifically for the purpose of determining eligibility for FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme) protection [#SRC:eb355065b8865baf]. In parallel, insolvency practitioners are expected to consider matters in line with the insolvency practitioner\u2019s objectives and responsibilities under Section 99 of the Banking Act 2009 [#TGT:02363a43a51fdf7b]. Read together, this means the insolvency practitioner\u2019s decision-making should not treat facilitation of identity verification as a standalone discretionary step; rather, it should be approached as an action that may be used to support the eligibility determination where the pre-compensation-date verification gap exists, while ensuring the practitioner\u2019s overall approach remains consistent with their statutory objectives and responsibilities. The practical linkage is that the permitted facilitation addresses the missing verification needed to assess FSCS eligibility, and the required consideration frames how and why the practitioner proceeds in that context, given their role and responsibilities.",

The permission to use a retrospective calculation operates only as a constrained carve-out from that default and applies only to determine the liabilities in specific cases [#TGT:30f622a929df3844].

The insolvency trigger is not limited to the CCP itself: the condition is met if the CCP, the clearing member, or one or more other clients of the clearing member becomes insolvent, provided the posted collateral remains bankruptcy remote in that scenario.

The firm should therefore calibrate its downturn PPGD and downturn LGD assumptions so they are mutually consistent: the PPGD downturn property-value fall must at least meet the PRA\u2019s deflation floors, while the LGD framework should be anchored to the PRA\u2019s 40% peak-to-downturn sales-price reduction reference point and incorporate the forced-sale component described by the PRA.

    "gold_answer": "A person fits the definition if they are indebted to a society in respect of a loan that is fully secured on land, or, where the Rules so provide, substantially secured on land [#TGT:7856ac9ac9cb1882]. That matters because the permission on derivative investments is framed around limiting exposure to specified changes, including changes in the creditworthiness of any borrower(s) [#SRC:bf19a4f593cb137a]. So, if the society is considering derivatives to manage the risk that a borrower\u2019s ability to repay deteriorates, it should first confirm the borrower is indebted to the society under a qualifying land-secured loan as described in the definition. If that condition is met, the permission supports using derivative investments to limit the extent to which the society, its subsidiary undertaking, or a connected undertaking will be affected by that borrower creditworthiness change. The same permission also covers limiting impacts from interest rates, exchange rates, and certain price indices, but the borrower-creditworthiness link is the key connection to the defined land-secured indebtedness category.",

    "gold_answer": "The permitted asset exposure limits are defined by reference to the limits that are set out elsewhere, and an Authorised Person should treat those limits as the governing framework for what is permitted in relation to asset exposure [#SRC:4a2c6b4a1519f187]. Within that framework, a specific land-related exposure category is defined as 5% for a piece of land or a number of pieces of land (including one or more interests in such pieces of land) where, in the most recent proper valuation, an aggregate value is ascribed to the relevant pieces of land that is greater than the aggregate of the value of each piece of land or interest valued separately [#TGT:e0fdde5fe1fac33a]. Practically, this means the compliance assessment must (i) identify whether the asset exposure is to a \u201cpiece of land\u201d (or multiple pieces, or interests), (ii) confirm that the valuation used is the most recent proper valuation, and (iii) test whether the valuation methodology produces an aggregate value that exceeds the sum of separate valuations.

    "gold_answer": "To decide what would generally be expected to be written down, you need to combine the legal definition of excluded liabilities for secured amounts with the PRA\u2019s stated approach to write-down plans. Legally, an amount secured on property is treated as an excluded liability, but there is an important exception: if the security is a charge that, as created, was a floating charge, that secured amount is not treated as excluded on that basis (Section 377B(1)(d) of FSMA) [#TGT:8a41e3fa3a9296cc]. The PRA then explains how this plays out in practice: it recognises that liabilities secured by floating charges are not excluded liabilities and may therefore be written down, and it links this to avoiding an inappropriate and unintended priority for inward reinsurance creditors who often have floating charges but are contractually subordinated to rank alongside direct policyholders (who have a statutory priority) [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96]. As a result, where floating-charge liabilities are not subordinated in that way, the PRA says they would generally be expected to be written down only after lower-ranking liabilities, following the creditor hierarchy [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96].",

    "gold_answer": "The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) supervisory statement is framed as setting out the PRA\u2019s expectations for banks\u2019 model risk management (MRM), and it also makes clear that the PRA considers model risk to be a risk in its own right [#SRC:af03f7cbf472c97d].

At the same time, the use of \u201cbanks\u201d in the title is specifically intended to signal an exclusion: the expectations do not apply to insurers or reinsurers [#TGT:c120c182f73a34aa].

Putting those points together, you should treat the pre\u201131/12/2024 Appendix 1 content as historical and understand that it may not match the latest version of the tests.

    "gold_answer": "If a firm holds assets with cash flows whose timing is uncertain but bounded (for example, where redemption or the start of repayments can vary within a contractually bounded period), the firm should consider whether those assets meet the criteria for HP cash flows and, if they do, it may include them in the MA portfolio within the limited proportion allowed for such assets [#SRC:e9aa8247582c38d4].

    "gold_answer": "A firm may be permitted not to comply with certain requirements where, in view of the nature, scale and complexity of its business and the nature and range of the relevant services and activities, compliance would not be proportionate, provided that the firm\u2019s compliance function is, and continues to be, effective [#SRC:029ad42316e71977]. Even where that permission applies, the firm remains subject to an overarching obligation to ensure that the compliance function is able to discharge its responsibilities properly and independently [#TGT:56dd025c30f9e7e2]. Read together, this means the firm cannot treat the proportionality-based non-compliance as a relaxation of the need for an effective compliance function; rather, it must maintain arrangements that support proper and independent performance of the compliance function\u2019s responsibilities while also ensuring the function remains effective on an ongoing basis.

    "gold_answer": "A TWD firm can use the PRA\u2019s templates and accompanying instructions as the main reference point for what the PRA would expect the firm to be able to produce under the SS, because those materials are described as providing a guide to the breadth and granularity of the required data outputs [#TGT:13cf146179026c2c]. Template A (Appendix 1) helps the firm make that expectation more concrete by showing the kind of data breadth and detail that should be available to demonstrate a specific capability: analysing exit costs and liquidity flows. In doing so, Template A highlights that the firm should be able to segment the balance sheet by method and price of exit, which implies the firm\u2019s data production needs to support those breakdowns so the analysis can be performed in a structured way rather than at a single aggregated level [#SRC:87a878c6bb1a14e8]. So, the firm should compare what it can currently produce against the PRA\u2019s templates/instructions generally, and then use Template A as a focused check that it can produce sufficiently granular, segmented balance-sheet data to support exit-cost and liquidity-flow analysis as expected [#TGT:13cf146179026c2c] [#SRC:87a878c6bb1a14e8].",

    "gold_answer": "In determining whether a deposit falls within the scope of the rule that decides if it is an eligible deposit, a firm must apply the PRA\u2019s expectation that it takes reasonable steps to ascertain a local authority\u2019s annual budget, because that information is relevant to whether the local authority is eligible for the purposes of the eligibility determination [#TGT:02fb0fbf6939a082].

For PDs that are long-run averages of one-year default rates for obligor grades or pools, the PRA expects the firm to estimate expected default rates over a representative mix of good and bad economic periods, instead of simply taking the historic average of default rates the firm actually incurred over a period of years [#TGT:13e5135f24e80eea]. This means the \u201cright\u201d length is the one that helps capture that representative mix, not just the number of years on hand.

    "gold_answer": "For CET1 and AT1, a firm must notify the PRA ahead of time when it intends to issue the instrument or when it intends to amend or vary its terms, as long as the instrument will count towards regulatory capital resources or own funds.

This matches the PRA Rulebook description that CET1 and AT1 issuances require pre-issuance notification [#TGT:b9bc12dacc3dd268]. Tier 2 is handled differently: instead of a one-month pre-notice, the firm must notify the PRA immediately after it issues a Tier 2 capital instrument, and immediately after it amends or varies the terms of a Tier 2 capital instrument, where it will count towards regulatory capital resources or own funds [#SRC:1fbc1202165b9d05].

    "gold_answer": "In this context, IFRS 9 is the accounting standard that sets the rules for accounting for financial instruments and replaces the earlier rules in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1]. The PRA expects firms to hold a larger buffer or strengthen their capital position where necessary, and it will also assess firms\u2019 capital positions under transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 until the end of 2023 where firms are using these arrangements [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7]. The definition details that IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014 and, following endorsement for use in the EU, is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1]. Putting these together, when the PRA assesses a firm\u2019s capital position under the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements through end-2023, the relevant accounting baseline is the IFRS 9 framework (issued July 2014; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018; replacing IAS 39) that governs financial instruments accounting [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1].",

    "gold_answer": "When assessing the appropriateness of any grouping of policies, the best estimate must still be calculated transparently and in a way that enables a qualified expert to review both the calculation method and the resulting outputs. This means the grouping approach cannot be treated as a purely administrative step; it must be integrated into the best estimate methodology so that an expert reviewer can understand how the grouping was selected, how it affects the calculation method, and how it influences the results.

    "gold_answer": "An institution is allowed to calculate a single exposure value at netting set level for all transactions covered by a contractual netting agreement, but only if it meets the conditions attached to that permission [#TGT:1600c3275d4f97ef]. Separately, the rules on permanently combining the relevant methods draw a line between group use and single-institution use: institutions may combine those methods on a permanent basis within a group, but a single institution must not combine them on a permanent basis [#SRC:05cc39f7a09a2d78]. Putting these together, the netting-set exposure value permission does not remove the prohibition on permanent method-combination for a single institution. So, an institution may be able to compute one exposure value for the netting set if the contractual netting agreement conditions are met [#TGT:1600c3275d4f97ef], but if it is acting as a single institution it still cannot permanently mix the relevant methods; that permanent mixing is only allowed when done within a group [#SRC:05cc39f7a09a2d78].",

    "gold_answer": "Where reporting is being made on a group that includes more than one firm using an internal model, Firms and, where applicable, UK holding companies must submit to the PRA an annual analysis-of-change return using template AoC.01, and that submission must include both quantitative information and a supporting qualitative analysis, prepared in line with the relevant instructions for the template [#TGT:d0d445db94d0c556].

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The FSCS must reimburse interest owed on eligible deposits where the interest had accrued but had not been credited at the compensation date, except where the compensation sum arises from a temporary high balance [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f]. However, paying that interest does not increase the depositor\u2019s compensation beyond the maximum compensation sum payable for the depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits.

The \u201cnet income\u201d component used as the numerator is not left to general interpretation; it is specifically tied to a FINREP data point, meaning net income must be taken from row 355, column 01 of template F02.00 (FINREP) [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4]. Read together, this means the RoA numerator must be sourced from that precise FINREP location for each year included in the two-year averaging window, while the denominator remains total assets as required by the RoA calculation construct [#SRC:005b0d8588b51505]. Accordingly, compliance hinges on (i) using the FINREP-defined net income figure as the numerator and (ii) applying it in the ratio to total assets, with the resulting annual ratios then averaged over two years, ensuring the same definitional basis for net income throughout [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4].",

Where both appear to apply, the assessment should explain how the group-level processes or controls interact with, complement, or substitute for the capital framework or other means, so that the conclusion that the risk is \u201calready mitigated\u201d is traceable to the specific mechanism relied upon and avoids double-counting the same mitigation effect.",

    "gold_answer": "Scenario testing should be used to connect two complementary objectives: (1) selecting the subset of options that would likely be chosen to respond to specific stresses, and (2) demonstrating that the recovery plan is suitable across a range of different types of stress while showing how plan elements interact under those stresses. Practically, the scenario design should require the recovery plan to identify, for each specific stress, which options are realistically expected to be selected (i.e., a subset rather than an exhaustive list), and then use those selections as the basis for testing the plan\u2019s operation in that stress. The testing should explicitly examine how the chosen options work alongside other elements of the plan\u2014such as indicators and governance\u2014to show whether the plan functions coherently when pressures vary in type and severity. This approach ensures the scenario exercise is not merely theoretical, but instead focuses on likely decision pathways and their operational implications, while still supporting the broader demonstration that the recovery plan can be used in multiple stress conditions and that its components interact as intended [#SRC:db5203b384a28349] [#TGT:3cc3932a984e4450].",

    "gold_answer": "If a pooled asset exposure\u2019s underlying assets are exposed to economic risks, and the firm has enough evidence that the exposure is predictable, the firm may propose to apply the standard approach to the FS addition for event risks [#SRC:957d2122eefbf855].

Where more complete credible data becomes available to support more sophisticated modelling, the PRA links this definition to a practical benchmark for provision: a provision equal to one quarter of the difference in MA benefit from median to worst cash flows is described as broadly equivalent to targeting the 85th percentile of a fatter-tailed distribution, and this would likely demonstrate adequate provision for the additional retained cash flow variability risks [#TGT:24cba8bb8769696c].

    "gold_answer": "The qualifying shareholding date is defined by reference to the voting date: it is either the last day of the financial year immediately preceding the voting date, or\u2014where the voting date falls after the conclusion of the society\u2019s AGM commenced in that financial year\u2014the first day of the period that begins 56 days before the meeting date [#TGT:8b090799d8ee6d60]. That definition sets the date (or period) against which any shareholding condition must be tested for voting entitlement on a shareholding members resolution. However, when assessing whether a person meets a requirement for holding shares on that qualifying date (or during any required period), the person is prohibited from relying on a share account that has an overdrawn balance; such an overdrawn share account cannot be used to satisfy a shareholding requirement on a given date or during a given period [#SRC:5292b5d19dc62407].

In practical terms, the definition clarifies that sleeper collateral is not \u201coptional\u201d collateral; it is an existing obligation that is simply untriggered until a call occurs.
