    "question": "If a Mining Reporting Entity has already made a full Production Target disclosure, when can it leave out the detailed assumptions and proportion breakdown in a later update, and what does it still need to say in that later update (including any special warning statements)?",
    "gold_answer": "In its disclosure pursuant to Rule 11.8.2, a Mining Reporting Entity must include key details about how the Production Target was determined, including the material economic assumptions (or, if commercially sensitive, a statement that they are commercially sensitive and an explanation of the methodology used), all other material assumptions, any statement about forecast commodity pricing being arrived at on reasonable grounds, and the proportions of the Production Target based on Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources (including Inferred Mineral Resources), and any Exploration Target, plus the required viability and cautionary statements where applicable [#TGT:8f759494-7a3a-4888-a07b-abac6b73113a]. After it has made that earlier disclosure and it was compliant with the information requirements that would otherwise need to be repeated, the Mining Reporting Entity may make a later disclosure about the Production Target without re-including that otherwise-required information, but only if the later disclosure (1) points back to the earlier compliant disclosure and (2) confirms that the material assumptions in the initial disclosure still apply and have not materially changed [#SRC:9e79b83f-77f1-4597-a010-cd1013d0c6ef]. Also, the later disclosure must still include an at least equally prominent and proximate warning statement if the Production Target is wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources, and must include a similarly prominent proximate warning statement if the Production Target is based in part on an Exploration Target [#SRC:9e79b83f-77f1-4597-a010-cd1013d0c6ef].",

    "gold_answer": "For each Islamic Contract included in PSIACOMcredit, an Authorised Person must run through a contract-level process: identify the relevant Islamic Contracts, value the underlying investment or asset for each one, and reduce that value as required to arrive at the contract-specific value used in the PSIACOMcredit calculation [#SRC:ad52577a-53d9-469d-ba7a-ae9b4c0a7787]. If the contract results in a CR Exposure that is not past due for more than 90 days, the Authorised Person must categorise that exposure into one of the specified asset classes (for example, cash items, central government/central bank, bank, corporate, regulatory retail, residential mortgage, commercial real estate, or other Exposures) [#TGT:0699660d-a2de-4359-8468-2d993b6a712f]. This categorisation is the required classification step that the Authorised Person must have in place when it determines the risk weighting or capital charge (CRW) appropriate to the contract. Once the CRW is determined, the Authorised Person applies the relevant formula to calculate PSIACOMcredit for that contract and then sums the PSIACOMcredit across all contracts to determine the total PSIACOMcredit applicable to the Authorised Person [#SRC:ad52577a-53d9-469d-ba7a-ae9b4c0a7787].",

For the collateralised portion, it sets E equal to the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight (CRW) that would apply to that collateral as if the Authorised Person had a direct exposure to it. For the uncollateralised portion, it sets E equal to the E of the CR Exposure minus the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight that is applicable to the obligor. It then calculates RWA amounts using E multiplied by the applicable risk weight and adds up the RWA amounts across all CR Exposures [#TGT:5c99a9f9-b97d-4f45-834a-0562c13cf368].",

    "gold_answer": "Across both provisions, the Regulator\u2019s ability to impose a supplementary fee is framed as a conditional permission tied to expected substantial additional cost or effort. In the specific context of filing a Supplementary Prospectus, the default position is that filing alone does not lead to any fee; however, if the review of that Supplementary Prospectus will require the Regulator to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort in conducting its review, the Regulator may require payment of a supplementary fee [#SRC:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb]. The broader permission confirms the same underlying threshold\u2014where the Regulator expects to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort\u2014and clarifies that this may arise not only in review of a filing but also in dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or when conducting on-going supervision [#TGT:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080]. Read together, the Supplementary Prospectus scenario is an example of the wider category: a filing that, due to the anticipated burden on the Regulator, can justify a supplementary fee, but only when the substantial-cost/effort condition is met.",

    "question": "If an Authorised Person is working out CET1 deductions for investments in CET1 Capital instruments of Relevant Entities, what calculation basis must be used for Trading Book holdings (including any netting rules), and what is the general rule about using gross long positions?",
    "gold_answer": "The two texts together require the Authorised Person to apply a general calculation principle while also following a specific Trading Book method when it applies. The SOURCE states that, for the relevant purposes, the amount of holdings of CET1 Capital instruments and other capital instruments of Relevant Entities to be deducted must be calculated on the basis of gross long positions (and it notes this is subject to another rule) [#SRC:40c66431-d7b0-41ae-bc47-0ae63f4d9454]. The TARGET then explains that, for the relevant purposes, an Authorised Person must make the deductions by calculating holdings in the Trading Book on the basis of the net long position in the same underlying Exposure, but only if the short position\u2019s maturity matches the long position\u2019s maturity or the short has a residual maturity of at least one year [#TGT:f6640865-b279-44c1-941f-091a1619258c].

    "gold_answer": "Filing a Supplementary Prospectus does not automatically result in an extra fee. The specific rule states that the filing itself does not trigger payment unless the review of the Supplementary Prospectus will require the Regulator to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort when conducting its review; only in that situation may the Regulator require payment of a supplementary fee [#SRC:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb]. The general supplementary-fee provision uses the same threshold\u2014where the Regulator expects substantial additional costs or substantial additional effort\u2014and explains that this permission can apply in a wider set of situations, including dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or when conducting on-going supervision [#TGT:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080].

    "gold_answer": "Across the two provisions, the Investigator is permitted to enter business premises to inspect and copy documents, but the exercise of that access is framed in two complementary ways: a general investigative permission tied to document relevance, and a notice-based mechanism that can compel a person to allow entry.

    "question": "When the Regulator discloses Confidential Information, may it make the permission to disclose subject to conditions, including requirements around obtaining consents and ensuring the recipient applies disclosure restrictions that are at least equivalent to the relevant confidentiality restrictions?",
    "gold_answer": "Yes. The framework permits the Regulator, when making a disclosure of Confidential Information, to attach conditions to the permission to disclose, to the extent the Regulator considers appropriate. Those conditions may address how the disclosure is managed, including requiring the obtaining of consents and, where appropriate, requiring that information received is subjected to restrictions on further disclosure that are at least equivalent to the relevant confidentiality restrictions. This means the Regulator can structure the permission so that disclosure is not unconditional, but instead is controlled through specified safeguards that govern the handling of the Confidential Information by the recipient. The same permission also allows the Regulator to restrict the uses to which the disclosed Confidential Information may be put, reinforcing that both onward disclosure and downstream use can be constrained as part of the disclosure arrangement. These powers are described as enabling the Regulator to impose conditions on the information disclosed and to restrict uses [#SRC:5b971fba-9c2c-40a0-9b54-e38c1d4d3350], and are reflected in the permission to disclose being made subject to conditions (including consents and equivalent restrictions) insofar as the Regulator considers appropriate [#TGT:98d99b60-b14d-4468-becd-e2c79c8f8b4a].",

    "gold_answer": "If a Recognised Investment Exchange is admitting to trading a Financial Instrument that references an underlying benchmark or index provided by a Price Reporting Agency, the exchange must carry out appropriate due diligence to ensure the Price Reporting Agency meets the relevant requirements [#SRC:69082061-a103-4087-acae-fa41e87fd0da]. In practical terms, the checks must cover whether the Price Reporting Agency has fair, non-discriminatory procedures for establishing prices and whether those procedures are made public; and whether it can demonstrate adequate transparency over its methodology, calculation, and inputs so users can understand how the benchmark or index is derived and what its potential limitations are [#TGT:8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a]. The exchange should also assess whether, where appropriate, the Price Reporting Agency gives priority to concluded transactions and has measures to minimise selective reporting; whether it is of good standing and repute as an independent and objective price reporting agency or index provider; and whether it has a sound corporate governance framework [#TGT:8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a]. The due diligence must further consider whether the Price Reporting Agency has adequate arrangements to avoid staff conflicts of interest that could materially adversely affect the price establishment process, and whether it maintains adequate complaint resolution mechanisms for its assessment process and methodology [#TGT:8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a].",

    "question": "For an Authorised Person, what conditions must be satisfied to be treated as Category 2, and how does that classification differ from Category 1 where the Financial Services Permission covers deposit-taking or managing a PSIAu?",
    "gold_answer": "An Authorised Person is in Category 2 where its Financial Services Permission authorises it to carry on one or both of the Regulated Activities of Providing Credit or Dealing in Investments as Principal (and not merely acting as Matched Principal), its dealing activities are not limited in scope in the way contemplated for certain limited dealing permissions, and it does not meet the criteria of Categories 1 or 5 [#SRC:6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f]. The Target text reinforces that Category 2 status is determinatively driven by authorisation for Dealing in Investments as Principal (not only as a Matched Principal) or Providing Credit, together with the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rule 1.3.1, and it also clarifies that where dealing is limited to acting only as Matched Principal, the firm\u2019s activities fall within Category 3A rather than Category 2 [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66]. By contrast, Category 1 is determinatively based on authorisation to Accept Deposits or to Manage a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, provided the Authorised Person does not meet Category 5; other authorisations may exist but do not drive the Category 1 classification [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66].",
    "generated_answer": "An Authorised Person is treated as Category 2 where its Financial Services Permission authorises it to conduct Providing Credit and/or Dealing in Investments as Principal, provided that the dealing is not limited to acting only as Matched Principal. [#6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f] It must also not meet the criteria for Category 1 or Category 5. [#6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f] By contrast, Category 1 applies when the permission includes Accepting Deposits or Managing a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, and the firm is not Category 5. [#e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66] In Category 1, that deposit-taking or PSIAu management authorisation is the key determinant, even if other activities are also permitted.
