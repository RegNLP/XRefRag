[#TGT:af842f40700e6ff3] Under that approach, the firm may recognise only part of the asset’s cash flows—specifically, it can continue to recognise cash flows up to the level of the contractual compensation payable—so that compensation remains sufficient to replace the cash flows needed to match the relevant MA eligible liabilities.

[#TGT:30f622a929df3844] First, a retrospective calculation is allowed where a prospective method cannot be applied to a particular type of contract or benefit; this is an exception that depends on the nature of the contract or benefit, even though the liability is still being determined for each contract. [#TGT:30f622a929df3844] [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb] Second, even if a prospective method could be applied, you may use a retrospective calculation if you can demonstrate that the liabilities it produces would be no lower than what would be required by a prudent prospective calculation; the key requirement is the demonstration of a non-lower outcome against that prudent prospective benchmark.
