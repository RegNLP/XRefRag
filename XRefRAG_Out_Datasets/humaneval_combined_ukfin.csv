9243085aea547dcc,"For credit unions within the PRA’s expected scope for concentration limits based on asset size or holding certain investments, when may those limits be treated as inapplicable because the funds are only being held temporarily pending an investment decision, and how should that boundary be understood alongside the stated scope and exceptions?","Taken together, the two passages indicate that the PRA’s expectation to adhere to concentration limits applies to a defined set of credit unions—those with more than £10 million in total assets and any credit unions that hold investments falling under the specified Rules—subject to stated exceptions for certain investments. Within that overall scope, the PRA also indicates a specific circumstance in which the relevant limits are not intended to bite: where funds are held only temporarily in an account before an investment decision is made. In practice, this means a credit union that would otherwise be expected to follow the concentration limits because it meets the asset threshold or holds the relevant types of investments should treat the limits as not applying to the interim holding of cash-like balances that are merely parked pending a decision, rather than representing an investment position. This temporary-holding carve-out sits alongside (and does not replace) the broader scope statement and the separate exception for listed investments, so the credit union should distinguish between pre-decision temporary funds and actual investments to which the concentration limits are expected to apply.

[#TGT:0bace533be32cdc7] In practice, this means the firm’s analysis must focus on whether the component is contractually guaranteed and separable for management purposes, rather than relying on a payment schedule (initial premium plus later instalments) to justify splitting the contract. [#SRC:4d0f75998fee0e4e] The PRA expects a detailed assessment showing that the only liability elements included in the MA portfolio are guaranteed and not dependent on future premiums or future investment performance, and the firm should also articulate a clear policy on where future attaching bonuses will be added (within the MA portfolio or elsewhere). [#TGT:0bace533be32cdc7] The underlying rationale is that notional splitting would undermine the insurer’s ability to manage the MA portfolio separately from the rest of the business, which is a requirement tied to regulation 4(6)(b) as referenced in the SOURCE.

[#SRC:5376e785ce2625b1] In the same context, the framework also points to a related requirement under Matching Adjustment 6.1 that the probability of default is adjusted (where possible and appropriate) to reflect differences in credit quality by rating notch, aligning the PD treatment with the basic fundamental spread’s notch sensitivity. [#SRC:5376e785ce2625b1] Accordingly, when the asset falls within credit quality steps 1–5 and is not in the category using published government/central bank tables, the firm’s compliance outcome is to implement a rating-notch-reflective adjustment to the fundamental spread while also recognizing that the PD is expected to be notch-adjusted under 6.1 on the same “where possible and appropriate” basis. [#TGT:9fdf13a401180fa3] [#SRC:5376e785ce2625b1]","Firms are required to reflect differences in credit quality by rating notch in the basic FS (where possible and appropriate) for all assigned assets that do not use published FS tables for assets issued by governments and central banks. Matching Adjustment 6.1 requires the PD to be adjusted (where possible and appropriate) to reflect differences in credit quality by rating notch. Firms are also required to reflect such differences in the basic FS, which can be done by either:","Where an assigned asset has a credit rating or internal credit assessment of a comparable standard (within the meaning of 7.1(1) ) mapping to credit quality steps 1 to 5 (inclusive), a firm with a matching adjustment permission must make an adjustment to the fundamental spread derived from the credit quality step attributed to that asset in order to reflect the corresponding rating notch , in accordance with 6.3 and 6.4 .",DPEL,dev,professional,5376e785ce2625b1,9fdf13a401180fa3,pra_rulebook__www.prarulebook.co.uk_guidance_supervisory-statements_ss07-18---solvency-ii-matching-adjustment,pra_rulebook__www.prarulebook.co.uk_pra-rules_matching-adjustment,5376e785ce2625b1,9fdf13a401180fa3
f13b2769f8900866,"When setting a rate of interest for the purposes of 11.1, how do the limits based on (i) the adjusted overall yield on assets and (ii) the assumed yield on an individual asset attributed to the long-term insurance business (including the 2.5% reduction) interact, and what practical cap should be applied to ensure compliance across both the portfolio and asset levels?","To comply when determining a rate of interest for the purposes of 11.1, the rate must be constrained by both a portfolio-level ceiling and an asset-level ceiling, so the practical cap is the most restrictive outcome produced by applying both limits. [#SRC:3a577ffac5cf0ceb] At the portfolio level, the rate of interest determined for 11.1 is not permitted to be higher than the adjusted overall yield on assets, where that adjusted overall yield is computed as a weighted average of the reduced yields on the individual assets (with those reduced yields being the figures arrived at under 11.2). [#SRC:3a577ffac5cf0ceb] In parallel, for each asset attributed to the long-term insurance business, the assumed yield used for 11.1 (before any tax-effect adjustment) must not be higher than the yield on that asset calculated under 11.3 to 11.13, after reducing that calculated yield by 2.5% of itself. [#TGT:82f678b5a7efdda8] Practically, this means you should (i) ensure each asset’s assumed yield respects the “11.3–11.13 yield minus 2.5% of that yield” limit, and then (ii) ensure the overall 11.1 rate does not exceed the weighted-average adjusted overall yield derived from the reduced individual-asset yields.
