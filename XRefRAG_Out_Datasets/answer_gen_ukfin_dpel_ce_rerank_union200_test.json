    "gold_answer": "When the firm is allocating model risk management responsibilities into senior management functions, it should not only follow the board\u2019s documented framework and senior management\u2019s role in running it, but also take into account the relevant prescribed responsibilities in the PRA Rulebook\u2019s \u2018Allocation of Responsibilities\u2019 4.1 or 5.2. [#SRC:d4070cd7428fcd33] [#TGT:51ea2b168d63b6d3] The board of directors should set up and document the framework for managing model risk, and senior management is responsible for executing and maintaining it, including assigning roles and responsibilities to model owners, model users, and control and compliance functions. [#SRC:d4070cd7428fcd33] Because the Target text specifically addresses assignments to senior management functions, the firm should consider the prescribed responsibilities in the cited \u2018Allocation of Responsibilities\u2019 sections when making those allocations.

    "gold_answer": "The management body must appoint a compliance officer, and that compliance officer must be responsible for the compliance function and for any compliance reporting required for the firm\u2019s obligations under the regulatory system and General Organisational Requirements 4.7. [#SRC:08b491dc52b89657] Separately, the firm must make sure its senior management receive written reports frequently and at least annually on the matters covered by the Compliance and Internal Audit and Risk Control Parts. [#TGT:37d016c3c16067f3] To connect these requirements in practice, the compliance officer\u2019s responsibility for compliance reporting should be used to drive the preparation and delivery of those written reports to senior management on the required schedule. [#SRC:08b491dc52b89657] [#TGT:37d016c3c16067f3] The written reports to senior management must also indicate whether appropriate remedial measures were taken when deficiencies occurred, so the reporting overseen by the compliance officer needs to include both identification of deficiencies and an update on whether remediation has been completed.

[#TGT:68113e9f6b9da4d1] Beyond putting that marking in place, the PRA expects the firm to be able to produce account information that separates eligible accounts from ineligible accounts, so the two categories are clearly distinguished in what is provided to supervisors or the compensation scheme.

    "gold_answer": "If items of a related undertaking are assumed not to be effectively available to cover the group SCR, that assumption frames the availability assessment for group SCR coverage across several types of related undertakings, including Solvency II undertakings, third country insurance undertakings, third country reinsurance undertakings, insurance holding companies, and mixed financial holding companies.

    "gold_answer": "A deferred contribution must be paid once making the payment no longer threatens the firm\u2019s liquidity and solvency, and any PRA-granted deferral of a class A2 member\u2019s share of a recapitalisation payment levy cannot run for more than six months at a time, though it may be renewed if the firm asks. [#SRC:f026573295165d20] [#TGT:9b64fbbd8245427b] The trigger for payment is the point at which paying the deferred amount ceases to jeopardise the liquidity and solvency of the firm, meaning the deferral is not a permanent waiver but a timing adjustment tied to the firm\u2019s financial condition. [#SRC:f026573295165d20] The PRA\u2019s ability to defer applies where it considers that the contributions would jeopardise the liquidity or solvency of the firm, and it may defer the obligation in whole or in part for a class A2 member in relation to a recapitalisation payment levy.

    "gold_answer": "A firm may only treat part of an income protection contract separately for MA portfolio composition where that part qualifies as an eligible element, and the PRA\u2019s discussion of \u201cin-payment elements\u201d is framed as potentially eligible only when they are separately identifiable and can be organised and managed separately (including in line with regulation 4(6) of the IRPR regulations).

[#TGT:5059cf1db1f509c9] When that settlement risk comes from products outside the scope of an advanced CCR model, and the firm\u2019s settlement-risk management is not adequate, the PRA may question whether it is appropriate for the firm to apply a zero capital requirement to that settlement risk. [#SRC:6c6326c6d1c86320] Adequate management is illustrated by controls such as pre-deal checking, defined limit frameworks, and appropriate reporting; weaknesses in these kinds of measures are the type of situation in which the PRA may intervene. [#SRC:6c6326c6d1c86320] If the PRA does challenge the zero capital approach, it can require the firm to hold additional capital under Pillar 2 to address the settlement risk. [#SRC:6c6326c6d1c86320] In other words, the fact that these products\u2019 settlement risk does not attract counterparty credit risk does not, by itself, prevent a Pillar 2 capital add-on if settlement-risk controls are not strong for exposures outside the advanced CCR model.

    "gold_answer": "The default position is that the amount of the long-term insurance liability is to be calculated prospectively for each contract, meaning the starting assumption is a prospective calculation on a contract-by-contract basis. [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb] A retrospective calculation is permitted only as an exception to that default, and only in limited circumstances tied to the feasibility and prudence of the prospective approach. [#TGT:30f622a929df3844] Specifically, a retrospective calculation may be used where a prospective method cannot be applied to a particular type of contract or benefit, which links the contract-level determination requirement to a contract/benefit-type limitation on method selection. [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb] [#TGT:30f622a929df3844] Alternatively, even if a prospective method could be applied, a retrospective calculation may be used where it can be demonstrated that the liabilities produced would be no lower than the amount that would be required by a prudent prospective calculation; in that case, the justification hinges on demonstrating a non-lower outcome relative to a prudent prospective benchmark. [#TGT:30f622a929df3844] In all cases, the prospective calculation remains the baseline method for determining the long-term insurance liability for each contract, and the retrospective approach is only available within the stated exception conditions.

[#TGT:ad978d8ce164b1e0] Where data required for inclusion are not held or are not applicable, the firm should keep the relevant fields present in the SCV and exclusions view file but leave those fields empty, so the files remain standard in length.

For the person\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits, the maximum compensation sum payable is \u00a3120,000, although the text notes that extra compensation may be payable in cases that fall under 4.3 or 4.4. [#SRC:336f75f8cdcde56e] For a temporary high balance, the maximum compensation sum is \u00a31,400,000, and that maximum is stated to apply subject to 4.4. [#TGT:b5fbb2a524d9ce87] There is also a specific situation where the temporary high balance has no cap at all: if the temporary high balance comes from a payment connected with personal injury or incapacity, then no limit applies to the compensation payable for that temporary high balance. [#TGT:b5fbb2a524d9ce87] Putting these together, a person could be limited to \u00a3120,000 for their aggregate eligible deposits while still being able to claim temporary high balance compensation up to \u00a31,400,000 (or without limit in the personal injury or incapacity payment case), with both the aggregate-deposit and temporary-high-balance rules referencing 4.4 as a relevant condition.

    "gold_answer": "The insurer should be able to show that any planned dividend payment makes sense when compared to (1) how the business has performed and is expected to perform and (2) the insurer\u2019s capital position now and in the future, and it should do this while taking its documented risk appetite into account.

    "gold_answer": "Where a firm is using IFRS 9 transitional arrangements, the PRA\u2019s decision on whether the firm should hold a larger buffer or strengthen its capital position is based on a combination of prudential factors and a time-limited transitional assessment. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] The PRA expects firms to increase buffers or strengthen capital where necessary in light of factors including the firm\u2019s leverage ratio, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, risks associated with double leverage, and whether potentially significant risks are not fully captured by the stress test. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] In addition, up to the end of 2023, the PRA will assess firms\u2019 capital positions under transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 when firms are using those arrangements. [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] This transitional focus is tied to IFRS 9\u2019s role as the accounting standard for financial instruments: IFRS 9 set new accounting rules for financial instruments and replaced IAS 39, and it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (after EU endorsement). [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1] So, for firms using the transition, the PRA\u2019s capital-buffer judgement can reflect both the usual capital/risk indicators and the specific IFRS 9 transitional assessment through end-2023, in the context of IFRS 9\u2019s post-2018 replacement of IAS 39.

    "gold_answer": "In calculating the own funds requirement for its pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a QCCP, the institution must apply the approach specified in Article 308, and that calculation must be based on an exposure value determined under the rule for DFi. [#SRC:b21669d5cc795148] The exposure value for the institution\u2019s pre-funded contribution to the QCCP default fund (DFi) is the amount the institution has paid in, or alternatively the market value of assets it has delivered, and this starting amount must be reduced by any portion of that contribution that the QCCP has already used to absorb losses that arose after the default of one or more of the QCCP\u2019s clearing members.

[#SRC:b660733416fb3965] In RWA terms, \u201cnon-neutrality\u201d should be described as the typical outcome that the total RWAs for the securitisation tranches exceed the RWAs that would have been calculated for the same underlying portfolio if it had not been securitised. [#TGT:dbb9be39416dec17] The firm should also identify the specific mechanisms by which SEC-SA and SEC-IRBA introduce this non-neutrality: a risk weight floor that differs by STS classification (10% for STS positions and 15% for non-STS positions) and the supervisory \u201cp\u201d factor.

[#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] This transitional-assessment element relates to IFRS 9 as the accounting framework for financial instruments: IFRS 9 introduced new accounting rules for financial instruments and replaced the prior rules in IAS 39, and it became effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 (following EU endorsement). [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1] Taken together, the PRA\u2019s capital-buffer expectations may be informed by both the firm\u2019s prudential metrics and risk capture, and\u2014where applicable\u2014by how the firm\u2019s capital position is assessed under the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements through end-2023, in the context of IFRS 9\u2019s post-2018 effective regime replacing IAS 39.

    "gold_answer": "A firm should treat changes in its own credit standing as irrelevant for any valuation adjustment after the liability has been initially recognised, and this approach aligns with the specific rule that an insurance or reinsurance undertaking must not apply a valuation adjustment for changes in its own credit standing. [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6] In scope, the firm\u2019s obligation applies to financial liabilities that are valued under UK-adopted international accounting standards, and the valuation at the point of initial recognition must follow the referenced \u201c5\u201d requirement. [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6] After that initial recognition point, the firm is prohibited from making later valuation changes that reflect its own credit standing moving up or down. [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6] This is consistent with the Valuation 10.1 statement that there is to be no valuation adjustment that takes account of a change in the own credit standing of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. [#SRC:d6c3553c96db7f71] Read together, the combined effect is that, whether framed as a general firm requirement for financial liabilities post-initial recognition or as the Valuation 10.1 rule for an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, own-credit movements are not a permitted driver of valuation adjustments.

    "gold_answer": "To use an intragroup loan as an asset backing TPs, the firm needs to be able to show that the asset is invested in a way that matches the nature and duration of the firm\u2019s insurance and reinsurance liabilities and that it is in the best interests of all policyholders, while also considering any disclosed policy objectives. [#SRC:afb7633ef682266c] The PRA highlights that intragroup loans (and similar participations or arrangements) can be problematic under this standard because they may benefit shareholders without necessarily benefiting policyholders. [#TGT:19e81bc332eae024] The PRA also notes a specific risk: the issuer of the loan may be less willing or able to enforce repayment, particularly for upstream loans, which can undermine the case that the arrangement protects policyholders\u2019 interests. [#TGT:19e81bc332eae024] Because of these concerns, the PRA expects there is a high hurdle for firms to demonstrate that intragroup loans and participations are in policyholders\u2019 best interests, and therefore a high hurdle to demonstrate they are appropriate for covering TPs. [#TGT:19e81bc332eae024] This means the firm\u2019s explanation must satisfy both the general investment standard for TP-backing assets and the PRA\u2019s heightened scrutiny for intragroup transactions.

[#TGT:91473ca52a070954] This linkage matters because the COREP instructions for C17.01 and C17.02 explicitly redirect certain non-UK references (including the EBA supervisory disclosure reference) to UK equivalents, so your reporting should be based on the PRA-produced disclosure rather than the EBA publication. [#SRC:40ad42a86de28e1d] In other words, when you see the EBA supervisory disclosure reference in those instructions, you should navigate to the Bank of England prudential regulation area and retrieve the PRA disclosure from the Regulatory reporting \u2013 banking sector page, ensuring your template completion uses the UK-referenced source.

    "question": "If a firm is setting up its risk-management system, what does it need to cover so it both (a) includes risks used for the SCR and risks not fully captured there, and (b) meets the requirement that calibration takes account of all quantifiable risks (including the listed minimum risk types)?",
    "gold_answer": "The firm needs a risk-management system that is broad enough to cover the risks used in the SCR calculation and also any risks that are not, or not fully, included in that calculation, while also aligning with the calibration expectation that all quantifiable risks the firm faces are taken into account. [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876] [#TGT:f261181a95a3ca51] The system must be effective and properly integrated into the firm\u2019s organisational structure and decision-making processes, with proper consideration of the persons who have key functions, so that the calibration and risk coverage are embedded in how the firm is run. [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876] To make this concrete, the calibration requirement says quantifiable risks must be captured and names at least non-life underwriting risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk, market risk, credit risk, and operational risk. [#TGT:f261181a95a3ca51] The risk-management system must also cover at least these areas: underwriting and reserving; asset-liability management; investment risk management (especially derivatives, quasi-derivatives and similar commitments); liquidity risk and concentration risk management; operational risk management; and reinsurance and other risk-mitigation techniques. [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876] Putting these together, the firm should ensure its listed risk-management areas are used to identify and manage the minimum risk categories and any other quantifiable risks, including those not fully reflected in the SCR calculation. [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876] [#TGT:f261181a95a3ca51]",
    "generated_answer": "To set up its risk-management system, the firm must implement an effective framework of strategies, processes and reporting that continuously identifies, measures, monitors, manages and reports risks at both individual and aggregated levels, including interdependencies. [#ID:9f2e6ec1c2bc29ca] The system must cover all material risk exposures that could threaten solvency or financial position, and it must include risks reflected in the SCR as well as risks not included or not fully captured by the SCR. [#ID:b03a289b30a950b9] It should include a documented risk-management strategy aligned to business strategy, decision-making procedures, written policies that define and categorise material risks by type with approved tolerance limits, and reporting processes to monitor effectiveness and update the system as needed.

    "gold_answer": "The text says that all non-executive directors who are members of the management body\u2014whether independent or not\u2014have a binding obligation to act with honesty, integrity, and independence of mind. [#SRC:8e63907640d17c50] It also clarifies that \u201cindependence of mind\u201d is not just a label but a pattern of behaviour that shows up especially during board discussions and decision-making, where each board member should be able to reach sound, objective, and independent decisions and judgements. [#SRC:8e63907640d17c50] Alongside that, the same passage ties these expectations to specified internal conduct requirements by stating that non-executive directors are required under Rules 2.1\u20132.3 and 3.4 in the Conduct Rules Part of the Rulebook to act with integrity, due skill, care and diligence, and to be open and co-operative with regulators. [#SRC:8e63907640d17c50] The related EU law reference is shown separately as a citation to \u201cArticle 91(8) Capital Requirements Directive (2013/36/EU),\u201d including a link to the legislation source, which is the explicit place where the EU provision is identified in the provided materials.
