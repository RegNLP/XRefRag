The TARGET complements this by permitting the Regulator to require a Person to pay a supplementary fee when it expects to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort in dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or when conducting on-going supervision, which aligns with the SOURCE’s concept of additional burden translating into additional fee recovery [#TGT:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080]. Taken together, the framework supports the Regulator’s ability to levy extra charges in high-effort or high-cost cases affecting Applicants/Authorised Persons. As a practical compliance step, FSRA recommends that the Applicant/Authorised Person discuss fee implications with FSRA as early as practicable, so potential supplementary/additional fees can be anticipated and managed in advance [#SRC:43df6a6a-29a3-4dca-8203-57b209ce85cc].", "source_text": "FEES\nCumulative application of Fees\nPursuant to FEES Rule 1.2.4, the FSRA reserves its right to impose additional fees in circumstances where a ‘substantial additional’ regulatory burden is imposed on FSRA.

In that case, the Recognised Investment Exchange must also operate a market that complies with the Recognition Requirements, meaning it needs to maintain a compliant market alongside the operation of the MTF or OTF (including where those facilities are operated separately and may involve Virtual Assets). Practically, the permission to add or separate facilities (including an MTF using Virtual Assets) is conditional and scoped, and the obligation is cumulative: operating the MTF or OTF triggers the requirement to also operate a Recognition Requirements-compliant market. This ensures that, even where additional trading facilities are introduced under the Recognition Order, the Recognised Investment Exchange continues to operate a market meeting the Recognition Requirements as required [#TGT:85479490-968f-42f7-baaa-2580214b953d] while relying on the FSRA-permitted ability to operate the separate facilities [#SRC:fa3cde4e-a388-4d88-bb14-8242a2758cc0].", "source_text": "MULTILATERAL TRADING FACILITIES AND VIRTUAL ASSETS\nRecognised Investment Exchanges Operating an MTF using Virtual Assets\nThis means that a Recognised Investment Exchange (in addition to operating markets relating to the trading of Financial Instruments (including Digital Securities) can, where permitted by the FSRA and subject to MIR Rule 3.4.2, operate a separate MTF, OTF and/or MTF using Virtual Assets under its Recognition Order.", "target_text": "A Recognised Investment Exchange operating an MTF or an OTF, must also operate a market that complies with the Recognition Requirements.", "source_passage_id": "fa3cde4e-a388-4d88-bb14-8242a2758cc0", "target_passage_id": "85479490-968f-42f7-baaa-2580214b953d", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional"}
