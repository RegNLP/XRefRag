    "gold_answer": "A Relevant Person conducting a business risk assessment that addresses NFTF business and the use of eKYC Systems must both (i) identify and assess the money laundering risks its business faces and (ii) ensure the assessment is operationalised through mitigation in day-to-day activities, while considering relevant external mitigation measures.

    "gold_answer": "For an Offer involving Units, the combined effect is that the Chapter\u2019s provisions (and Rules made for that Chapter) do not apply to the person making the Offer, and the Rulebook\u2019s chapter 4 Prospectus content and structure requirements are also not applicable to Prospectuses relating to Units of Funds.

[#SRC:254251bf-b846-4357-af1b-961bfa5fff94] Instead, the Prospectus requirements that do apply to an Offer of Units of Funds are located in the Fund Rules, which are identified as the source of applicable Prospectus requirements for such Offers. [#SRC:254251bf-b846-4357-af1b-961bfa5fff94] This allocation is reinforced by the statement that Section 57(1) of FSMR disapplies chapter 4 of the Rulebook to Fund Prospectuses, aligning the Rulebook\u2019s chapter 4 non-application for Units of Funds with the broader non-application framework for the Chapter in relation to making an Offer of a Unit.

    "question": "If an Authorised Person in Category 3B, 3C or 4 is checking whether it needs to tell the Regulator about low Capital Resources, how should it use the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum (as part of the Capital Requirement under Section 3.6), and what exactly must it do when Capital Resources drop too far?",
    "gold_answer": "To decide whether it must notify the Regulator, an Authorised Person in Category 3B, 3C or 4 needs to compare its Capital Resources to its Capital Requirement, and that Capital Requirement is calculated under Section 3.6 with the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum included as a component. [#SRC:596309d5-cc1a-4a45-9e6d-2042ff11da76] The notification trigger occurs when Capital Resources fall below 120% of the Capital Requirement (meaning the 120% test is applied to the Capital Requirement figure that includes the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum component). [#TGT:bbfd9205-e2d8-4fa4-be46-44da5d8e990d] When that happens, the firm must notify the Regulator immediately and then confirm the notification in writing. [#TGT:bbfd9205-e2d8-4fa4-be46-44da5d8e990d] Because the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum is specifically described as relevant to determining whether the Regulator has to be notified under Rule 3.20.2, the firm should ensure it is using the correct Capital Requirement calculation when applying the 120% threshold. [#SRC:596309d5-cc1a-4a45-9e6d-2042ff11da76] Put together, the compliance steps are: compute the Capital Requirement under Section 3.6 (including the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum), monitor Capital Resources against 120% of that amount, and if the firm falls below, notify immediately and follow up with written confirmation.

[#30e8c996-ee31-4669-8661-d0b9d4645126] The Capital Requirement is the higher of the applicable Base Capital Requirement and the EBCM, so the firm should calculate both and use the higher figure when testing its Capital Resources position.

    "question": "For a Reporting Entity, how do the section 82 FSMR obligation to appoint an auditor and the requirement that the auditor be appointed in accordance with Part 15 and any Rules made for that Part operate together when making the appointment?",
    "gold_answer": "A Reporting Entity must ensure it has an auditor and that the appointment is made through the specific framework referenced for auditor appointments. [#TGT:74fee9ec-688d-43df-99e1-bc5b4f83f0fb] The baseline obligation is that the Reporting Entity is required to appoint an auditor under section 82 of the FSMR, so the entity cannot omit making an appointment. [#SRC:0b00ca08-6924-419e-b76d-dd66e5575a33] In addition, the appointment is not merely a general designation; it must be carried out in accordance with Part 15 and any Rules made for the purposes of that Part, meaning the Reporting Entity must follow that Part 15/Rules pathway when appointing the auditor. [#TGT:74fee9ec-688d-43df-99e1-bc5b4f83f0fb] Read together, section 82 establishes the duty to appoint, while the Part 15 and related Rules condition specifies the required method or procedural basis for how the auditor is appointed.

    "gold_answer": "For an Authorised Person seeking to amend an existing Financial Services Permission to add one or more additional Regulated Activities, the fee outcome is determined by combining (i) the obligation to pay the applicable application fees for the additional Regulated Activities and (ii) the method for calculating the total when multiple Regulated Activities are applied for at the same time.

    "gold_answer": "For the Countercyclical Capital Buffer calculation, the Authorised Person must treat the jurisdiction of a private sector credit exposure as the place where the underlying credit risk ultimately originates, based on the best identification it can make. [#TGT:ffc672ed-a781-4a71-bb0d-7fc38a2e0c7c] That jurisdiction identification matters because the buffer is calculated by taking the Authorised Person\u2019s Total Risk Exposure Amount and multiplying it by a weighted average of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates that apply to exposures in the jurisdictions where those private sector credit exposures are located. [#SRC:61013be0-a186-4ad3-9c9e-4fe2164b5b2c] In other words, the \u201clocation\u201d step determines which jurisdictional buffer rates are considered \u201capplicable\u201d for the weighted average, and the weighted average then directly drives the size of the buffer when applied to the Total Risk Exposure Amount. [#SRC:61013be0-a186-4ad3-9c9e-4fe2164b5b2c] The Authorised Person must therefore link each exposure to a jurisdiction by tracing the ultimate origin of the credit risk, and then use those jurisdictions\u2019 rates in the weighted-average component of the buffer formula.

    "gold_answer": "A person\u2019s execution of their own pre-formed intention to deal, by itself, is treated as not breaching section 92(2) (Insider Dealing); the compliance focus therefore shifts to whether the dealing is instead connected to \u201cInside Information\u201d as defined for the relevant instruments.

[#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] In practical terms, the firm should (1) confirm the person formed an intention to deal before dealing and recognize that carrying out that intention alone is not the contravention trigger, [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] and (2) separately test whether any information influencing the trade meets all elements of the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition (precise, non-public, relevant to Reporting Entities/Issuers or the instruments, and price-significant). [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] This linkage matters because the \u201cown intention\u201d concept addresses the act of dealing, while the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition supplies the characteristics of information that could make dealing problematic under an insider dealing analysis.
