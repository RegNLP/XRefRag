    "question": "If a Mining Reporting Entity has already made a full Production Target disclosure, when can it leave out the detailed assumptions and proportion breakdown in a later update, and what does it still need to say in that later update (including any special warning statements)?",
    "gold_answer": "In its disclosure pursuant to Rule 11.8.2, a Mining Reporting Entity must include key details about how the Production Target was determined, including the material economic assumptions (or, if commercially sensitive, a statement that they are commercially sensitive and an explanation of the methodology used), all other material assumptions, any statement about forecast commodity pricing being arrived at on reasonable grounds, and the proportions of the Production Target based on Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources (including Inferred Mineral Resources), and any Exploration Target, plus the required viability and cautionary statements where applicable [#TGT:8f759494-7a3a-4888-a07b-abac6b73113a]. After it has made that earlier disclosure and it was compliant with the information requirements that would otherwise need to be repeated, the Mining Reporting Entity may make a later disclosure about the Production Target without re-including that otherwise-required information, but only if the later disclosure (1) points back to the earlier compliant disclosure and (2) confirms that the material assumptions in the initial disclosure still apply and have not materially changed [#SRC:9e79b83f-77f1-4597-a010-cd1013d0c6ef]. Also, the later disclosure must still include an at least equally prominent and proximate warning statement if the Production Target is wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources, and must include a similarly prominent proximate warning statement if the Production Target is based in part on an Exploration Target [#SRC:9e79b83f-77f1-4597-a010-cd1013d0c6ef].",

    "gold_answer": "For each Islamic Contract included in PSIACOMcredit, an Authorised Person must run through a contract-level process: identify the relevant Islamic Contracts, value the underlying investment or asset for each one, and reduce that value as required to arrive at the contract-specific value used in the PSIACOMcredit calculation [#SRC:ad52577a-53d9-469d-ba7a-ae9b4c0a7787].

This categorisation is the required classification step that the Authorised Person must have in place when it determines the risk weighting or capital charge (CRW) appropriate to the contract.

For the collateralised portion, it sets E equal to the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight (CRW) that would apply to that collateral as if the Authorised Person had a direct exposure to it. For the uncollateralised portion, it sets E equal to the E of the CR Exposure minus the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight that is applicable to the obligor. It then calculates RWA amounts using E multiplied by the applicable risk weight and adds up the RWA amounts across all CR Exposures [#TGT:5c99a9f9-b97d-4f45-834a-0562c13cf368].",

    "gold_answer": "Across both provisions, the Regulator\u2019s ability to impose a supplementary fee is framed as a conditional permission tied to expected substantial additional cost or effort. In the specific context of filing a Supplementary Prospectus, the default position is that filing alone does not lead to any fee; however, if the review of that Supplementary Prospectus will require the Regulator to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort in conducting its review, the Regulator may require payment of a supplementary fee [#SRC:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb]. The broader permission confirms the same underlying threshold\u2014where the Regulator expects to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort\u2014and clarifies that this may arise not only in review of a filing but also in dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or when conducting on-going supervision [#TGT:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080].

    "question": "If an Authorised Person is working out CET1 deductions for investments in CET1 Capital instruments of Relevant Entities, what calculation basis must be used for Trading Book holdings (including any netting rules), and what is the general rule about using gross long positions?",
    "gold_answer": "The two texts together require the Authorised Person to apply a general calculation principle while also following a specific Trading Book method when it applies. The SOURCE states that, for the relevant purposes, the amount of holdings of CET1 Capital instruments and other capital instruments of Relevant Entities to be deducted must be calculated on the basis of gross long positions (and it notes this is subject to another rule) [#SRC:40c66431-d7b0-41ae-bc47-0ae63f4d9454]. The TARGET then explains that, for the relevant purposes, an Authorised Person must make the deductions by calculating holdings in the Trading Book on the basis of the net long position in the same underlying Exposure, but only if the short position\u2019s maturity matches the long position\u2019s maturity or the short has a residual maturity of at least one year [#TGT:f6640865-b279-44c1-941f-091a1619258c]. In practice, this means the gross long position basis is the general approach, while Trading Book holdings can be reduced to a net long position only where the offsetting short position meets the maturity conditions and relates to the same underlying Exposure.",
    "generated_answer": "For Trading Book holdings when calculating CET1 deductions for investments in CET1 instruments, the calculation should generally be based on the net long position rather than gross, but only where the long and short positions relate to the same underlying exposure and the short leg creates no counterparty credit risk. [#ID:16955eb9-6b0f-4f00-b762-c214613f30bf] If the exposure is held indirectly through index securities, the deduction should be determined by looking through the index to the underlying exposure to CET1 instruments included in it. [#ID:16955eb9-6b0f-4f00-b762-c214613f30bf] As a general rule, holdings are calculated using gross long positions, subject to these Trading Book netting and index look-through exceptions.

The TARGET clarifies the relevant scope of that second trigger by identifying that the variation or cancellation is one undertaken on the initiative of the Regulator, and that it concerns variation and cancellation of a Financial Services Permission [#TGT:445d41e7-27aa-41c1-84e4-194553261f8a].

The Mining Reporting Entity must include a clear, nearby statement that the estimates are Non-Equivalent Estimates, are not disclosed in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard, that a Competent Person has not done enough work to classify them as Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves under a Mining Reporting Standard, and that it is uncertain whether further evaluation/exploration will ever allow that. It must also include the sources and dates of the estimates; explain any Mineralisation categories used (and whether they match or differ from a Mining Reporting Standard); and cover relevance and reliability. In addition, it must summarise the work and assumptions behind the estimates, provide any newer relevant estimates/data with sources/dates, describe what work is needed to verify them (plus timing and funding), state the classification/reporting standard used, and include a named Competent Person statement confirming the accuracy of specified parts of the disclosure.",

    "question": "If someone files a Supplementary Prospectus, does that automatically mean they have to pay an extra fee, or can the Regulator only charge a supplementary fee when it expects substantial extra cost or work\u2014like it can for other filings, applications, authorisations, or on-going supervision?",
    "gold_answer": "Filing a Supplementary Prospectus does not automatically result in an extra fee. The specific rule states that the filing itself does not trigger payment unless the review of the Supplementary Prospectus will require the Regulator to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort when conducting its review; only in that situation may the Regulator require payment of a supplementary fee [#SRC:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb]. The general supplementary-fee provision uses the same threshold\u2014where the Regulator expects substantial additional costs or substantial additional effort\u2014and explains that this permission can apply in a wider set of situations, including dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or when conducting on-going supervision [#TGT:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080]. Putting both together, a Supplementary Prospectus filing is treated as a type of filing that normally carries no extra charge, but it can become chargeable if the Regulator anticipates that reviewing it will materially increase the resources needed, consistent with the broader approach to supplementary fees.",

[#33127e68-bce1-4ef1-a2b8-86217e654659] Where a supplementary fee is charged, the Regulator must notify the person of the amount as soon as reasonably possible, and it may charge further supplementary fees later.

    "gold_answer": "Across the two provisions, the Investigator is permitted to enter business premises to inspect and copy documents, but the exercise of that access is framed in two complementary ways: a general investigative permission tied to document relevance, and a notice-based mechanism that can compel a person to allow entry. Under the source, the Investigator may enter business premises for the purpose of inspecting and copying any documents where those documents are relevant for the purposes of the investigation [#SRC:6f288073-515c-4e53-9fa5-16c3700d2767].

Read together, the entry/inspection/copying purpose is consistent in both texts, while the target adds procedural and temporal constraints (written notice; normal business hours) and broadens who can be required to grant access, and the source emphasizes that the documents inspected/copied must be relevant to the investigation.",
    "generated_answer": "Yes.

The framework permits the Regulator, when making a disclosure of Confidential Information, to attach conditions to the permission to disclose, to the extent the Regulator considers appropriate. Those conditions may address how the disclosure is managed, including requiring the obtaining of consents and, where appropriate, requiring that information received is subjected to restrictions on further disclosure that are at least equivalent to the relevant confidentiality restrictions. This means the Regulator can structure the permission so that disclosure is not unconditional, but instead is controlled through specified safeguards that govern the handling of the Confidential Information by the recipient. The same permission also allows the Regulator to restrict the uses to which the disclosed Confidential Information may be put, reinforcing that both onward disclosure and downstream use can be constrained as part of the disclosure arrangement. These powers are described as enabling the Regulator to impose conditions on the information disclosed and to restrict uses [#SRC:5b971fba-9c2c-40a0-9b54-e38c1d4d3350], and are reflected in the permission to disclose being made subject to conditions (including consents and equivalent restrictions) insofar as the Regulator considers appropriate [#TGT:98d99b60-b14d-4468-becd-e2c79c8f8b4a].",
    "generated_answer": "Yes. The Regulator may make any disclosure of Confidential Information conditional, including by requiring consents to be obtained and, where appropriate, ensuring the recipient applies onward-disclosure limits that are at least as strict as the confidentiality duty in section 198. [#ID:5b971fba-9c2c-40a0-9b54-e38c1d4d3350] More generally, when disclosing under section 199(1), it can require the requesting authority to accept conditions and/or limits on how the information may be used, to the extent the Regulator considers suitable. [#ID:6b15279a-ffe6-4bc9-961d-d8d4a305ef6f] In practice, the Regulator may also prohibit voluntary onward disclosure to third parties without further Regulator consent and require advance notice if compelled disclosure is anticipated.

In practical terms, the checks must cover whether the Price Reporting Agency has fair, non-discriminatory procedures for establishing prices and whether those procedures are made public; and whether it can demonstrate adequate transparency over its methodology, calculation, and inputs so users can understand how the benchmark or index is derived and what its potential limitations are [#TGT:8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a]. The exchange should also assess whether, where appropriate, the Price Reporting Agency gives priority to concluded transactions and has measures to minimise selective reporting; whether it is of good standing and repute as an independent and objective price reporting agency or index provider; and whether it has a sound corporate governance framework [#TGT:8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a]. The due diligence must further consider whether the Price Reporting Agency has adequate arrangements to avoid staff conflicts of interest that could materially adversely affect the price establishment process, and whether it maintains adequate complaint resolution mechanisms for its assessment process and methodology [#TGT:8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a].",
    "generated_answer": "Where an exchange admits a Financial Instrument whose value is set by reference to a benchmark or index from a Price Reporting Agency (PRA), it must comply with Rule 3.11, which requires ensuring the PRA meets specified standards. [#a9b5571e-2d13-4cb0-b58f-9c251e6bd215] The exchange\u2019s checks should confirm the PRA has public, fair and non-discriminatory price-setting procedures and provides sufficient transparency on methodology, calculations and inputs (including limitations). [#8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a] It should also verify the PRA prioritises concluded transactions where appropriate, minimises selective reporting, and is independent with good standing, sound governance, conflict-of-interest controls, and effective complaint handling.

    "gold_answer": "A holding by an Authorised Person in a Relevant Entity must be treated as a significant investment if it meets any of the listed triggers: the Authorised Person owns more than 10% of the CET1 Capital instruments issued by the Relevant Entity; or the Authorised Person both has Close Links with the Relevant Entity and owns its CET1 Capital instruments; or the Authorised Person owns the Relevant Entity\u2019s CET1 Capital instruments and, while the Relevant Entity is not included in consolidation under the Rules, it is included in the same accounting consolidation as the Authorised Person for IFRS financial reporting [#SRC:c9f19d0b-d036-4cfe-88ba-7e2528a70c11].

    "gold_answer": "The Regulator can give directions to a Recognised Body to take specified steps to secure compliance with the Recognition Requirements, and those steps may include giving the Regulator access to the Recognised Body\u2019s premises to inspect the premises or documents there, as well as suspending the carrying on of any activity for a period set out in the direction [#TGT:83e95cf0-0fcf-4cb3-ab07-0404f8736500].

The Target text reinforces that Category 2 status is determinatively driven by authorisation for Dealing in Investments as Principal (not only as a Matched Principal) or Providing Credit, together with the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rule 1.3.1, and it also clarifies that where dealing is limited to acting only as Matched Principal, the firm\u2019s activities fall within Category 3A rather than Category 2 [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66]. By contrast, Category 1 is determinatively based on authorisation to Accept Deposits or to Manage a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, provided the Authorised Person does not meet Category 5; other authorisations may exist but do not drive the Category 1 classification [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66].",
    "generated_answer": "To be treated as Category 2, an Authorised Person must be authorised under its Financial Services Permission to conduct Providing Credit and/or Dealing in Investments as Principal (not merely as Matched Principal). [#ID:6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f] Its dealing activities must not be limited in scope in the way referenced in the Category 2 rule. [#ID:6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f] It also must not meet the criteria for Category 1 or Category 5. [#ID:6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f] By contrast, Category 1 applies where the permission includes Accepting Deposits or Managing a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, and that authorisation is what determines Category 1 status (subject to not being Category 5).
