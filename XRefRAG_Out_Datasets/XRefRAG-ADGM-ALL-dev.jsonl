{"item_id": "6a742f615e862329", "question": "How would the Regulator assess whether a trader’s conduct in a crude oil contract—rapidly accumulating more than 90% of the physical inventory, not offering to lend it back at a reasonable commercial rate, and then unwinding in the final settlement window at rapidly increasing prices—amounts to Behaviour that secures an abnormal or artificial price level, given the requirement that the transactions or orders be otherwise than for legitimate reasons and in conformity with Accepted Market Practices?", "gold_answer": "The described crude oil scenario can be assessed as potentially abusive where the trading strategy both creates an abnormal price outcome and is carried out through transactions or orders that are not for legitimate reasons and not in line with Accepted Market Practices on the relevant market. [#TGT:e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f] In the example, the trader rapidly amasses more than 90% of the physical inventory underlying the crude oil contract, does not offer to lend the crude oil back at a reasonable commercial rate, and then exits the position during the Exchange’s final settlement window at rapidly increasing prices, with the effect of cornering/squeezing the market. [#SRC:350b6237-da6f-47c6-b04c-10caf56bf9d7] That conduct is described as causing an abnormal movement in the price of crude oil contracts for forward month delivery, which aligns with the concept of securing the price at an abnormal or artificial level. [#SRC:350b6237-da6f-47c6-b04c-10caf56bf9d7] The “fusion” point is that the abnormal movement is achieved through the trader’s execution pattern (building the dominant inventory position and unwinding in the final settlement window), which is the type of transaction/order behaviour the rule targets when it is not undertaken for legitimate reasons and in conformity with Accepted Market Practices. [#TGT:e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f] On these facts, the Regulator’s example supports treating the strategy as an abusive squeeze that may contravene the relevant prohibition, while the rule frames the key test as abnormal/artificial price impact coupled with lack of legitimate/accepted-market-practice justification. [#SRC:350b6237-da6f-47c6-b04c-10caf56bf9d7] [#TGT:e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f]", "source_text": "Abusive squeezes. The following are specific examples of an abusive squeeze that, in the Regulator's view, may contravene section 92 (4)(b):\n(a)\tduring the course of a trading day on a Commodity Derivative Exchange, a trader rapidly builds up a position of more than 90% of the physical inventory underlying a crude oil contract.  The trader fails to Offer to lend the crude oil back to other market participants at a reasonable commercial rate.  The trader then unwinds his position in the Exchange's final settlement window  at rapidly increasing prices, thereby cornering/squeezing the crude oil market.  His conduct causes an abnormal movement in the price of crude oil contracts for forward month delivery; and\n(b)\ta trader with a long position in bond futures, buys or borrows a large amount of the bonds and either refuses to re-lend these bonds or will only lend them to parties he believes will not re-lend to the market.

The Authorised Person must pay the Regulator the application fees for the additional Regulated Activities as set out in Rule 3.2.1. [#SRC:f02f1e7a-a3ea-47cf-94df-8656a695fbd0] Where the amendment request covers multiple additional Regulated Activities at that time, the Authorised Person must pay the highest of the relevant application fees associated with the Regulated Activities being applied for at that time. [#TGT:4797c128-c19a-4af6-89ba-59fb6b9ac4d2] In addition, each extra Regulated Activity included in the same application (beyond the one driving the “highest” fee) triggers an additional fee, calculated as the lesser of $10,000 or the application fee specified in these Rules for that Regulated Activity. [#TGT:4797c128-c19a-4af6-89ba-59fb6b9ac4d2] Practically, this means the Rule 3.2.1 fee schedule supplies the relevant per-activity fees, while the multi-activity rule determines that the payable amount is anchored by the highest applicable fee plus capped incremental fees for each additional activity in the same submission.
