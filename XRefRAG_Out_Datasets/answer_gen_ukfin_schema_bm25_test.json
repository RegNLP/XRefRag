    "question": "When a firm is investing in assets covering technical provisions for linked long-term contracts of insurance, in what circumstances must it still apply the PRA\u2019s expectation to limit its investment where there is insufficient data to quantify asset risks, and when is that expectation outside scope?",
    "gold_answer": "The PRA\u2019s expectation that a firm should limit its investment appropriately where there is insufficient data to quantify the risks arises when the firm is considering the nature and quantification of risks for each category of asset and for individual assets [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8]. However, the scope of the relevant part of the chapter is restricted for firms investing in assets that cover technical provisions (TPs) for linked long-term contracts of insurance: those provisions do not apply to such firms, except in a specific carve-in [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. The carve-in is where the assets are held to cover the additional TPs in respect of policyholder liabilities, including liabilities for any guarantee of investment performance or other guaranteed benefit provided under those linked long-term contracts [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. Accordingly, the firm should treat the expectation to limit investment due to insufficient risk data as applicable when the assets fall within that exception (ie, held for additional TPs tied to policyholder liabilities and guarantees), and as not applicable under this chapter where the assets merely cover TPs for linked long-term contracts without meeting the exception [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6] [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8].",
    "generated_answer": "A firm investing in assets covering technical provisions (TPs) for linked long-term contracts generally falls outside the scope of the PRA expectations in this chapter, including the expectation to limit investment when asset-risk data is insufficient.

    "question": "If a credit union is expected by the PRA to follow concentration limits because it is over \u00a310 million in assets or holds certain investments, do those limits still apply when money is only sitting in an account for a short time before an investment decision is made?",
    "gold_answer": "Reading the two statements together, the PRA sets an expectation that certain credit unions should adhere to concentration limits: specifically, credit unions with more than \u00a310 million in total assets and any credit unions that hold investments that fall under the referenced Rules, with an additional note that there are exceptions for certain listed investments. At the same time, the PRA also explains that the limits are not intended to apply in a particular, narrow situation\u2014where funds are held temporarily in an account before an investment decision is made. So, even if a credit union is within the group the PRA expects to follow the concentration limits, it can treat those limits as not applying to money that is merely parked on a short-term basis while the credit union has not yet decided how to invest it. The key boundary is the purpose and timing of the holding: the carve-out is tied to pre-decision, temporary holding, whereas the expectation to adhere to concentration limits is directed at credit unions meeting the asset-size or investment-holding conditions, subject to the separate investment exceptions.

    "generated_answer": "No. Where the PRA expects a credit union (eg, because it has more than \u00a310 million in total assets or holds certain specified investments) to adhere to the concentration limits in paragraph 11.1, those limits are not intended to apply to funds that are only being held temporarily in an account while an investment decision is pending. [#ID:6cdd849d0a0503ce] The PRA\u2019s view is that paragraph 11.1 limits would not apply in that short interim period before the decision is made.

    "gold_answer": "Where Institutions choose to calculate exposure values for derivative positions using a particular method, they have a notification duty: they shall notify the competent authorities of the methods they use, or cease to use, to calculate the exposure value of their derivative positions [#SRC:7085c26bac1b91bb]. That obligation applies alongside the permission in the netting context: Institutions may calculate a single exposure value for all transactions within a contractual netting agreement only where the specified conditions are met; if those conditions are not met, Institutions must instead calculate an exposure value separately for each transaction, treating each transaction as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Practically, this means that whenever an Institution adopts (or stops using) a method to support either (i) a single exposure value approach for transactions within a contractual netting agreement, or (ii) separate exposure value calculations per transaction, it must notify the competent authorities of the relevant method change or continued use. The notification requirement is framed around the methods used to calculate exposure values, not around the netting permission itself, so Institutions should ensure their notifications align with the method(s) actually applied to the exposure value calculations in either scenario.",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The TARGET sets a two-step requirement for a firm: it must value financial liabilities (as referred to in UK-adopted international accounting standards) in the required way when the liability is first recognised, and then it must not make any later adjustment that takes account of a change in the firm\u2019s own credit standing after that initial recognition [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6].

Taken together, the practical rule is consistent across both texts: once the liability valuation is established at the relevant recognition point, later movements in the entity\u2019s own credit standing are not a permitted reason to adjust the valuation. The main difference is only who is being addressed (a firm versus an insurance or reinsurance undertaking) and the explicit linkage in the TARGET to initial recognition and subsequent adjustments.",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. Even if there are amounts that the FSCS has not been able to recover from DGS members as a result of the relevant levy outcomes described in the source, the FSCS is still constrained by the rule that sets a maximum annual amount of DGS compensation costs it can levy on DGS members [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380].

The unrecovered-amounts situation explains that some sums may remain unpaid or uncollected from DGS members, but it does not itself authorize the FSCS to exceed the cap [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380]. The only stated way the FSCS can levy more than the cap is if there are exceptional circumstances and the FSCS has the prior consent of the PRA; without that consent (and without exceptional circumstances), charging above the cap is prohibited [#TGT:ba641d05400bc860].",

    "question": "For the PRA\u2019s expectation about branches maintaining a threshold level of FSCS-covered retail and small company deposits, how must a firm determine whether the relevant balances are held in an \u201cinstant access account,\u201d and what operational feature of the account is decisive for that classification?",
    "gold_answer": "To apply the PRA\u2019s expectation for branches regarding the level of FSCS-covered retail and small company instant access deposit balances, the firm must first classify which account balances qualify as being in an \u201cinstant access account,\u201d because the expectation is specifically framed around \u201cFSCS covered instant access deposits\u201d held at branches and kept under the stated threshold [#SRC:5ad52e36aa024bad].

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The reduction is required to be carried out by making a deduction from the aggregate value of the assets that the firm would otherwise be permitted to take into account for the relevant purposes. That tells you how the firm must apply the reduction in practice: it is taken off the asset total that would otherwise be counted, rather than being handled as a separate adjustment outside the aggregate asset value. At the same time, the firm\u2019s aggregate value of assets must be reduced by an amount that represents the aggregate of specified components, and that obligation applies subject to the related provisions that frame how the reduction operates. Putting both requirements together, the firm must first identify the reduction amount as the aggregate of the relevant items, and then implement that reduction by deducting that amount from the aggregate asset value it would otherwise be allowed to include. This ensures the reduction is both correctly calculated and correctly applied to the asset base [#TGT:f960c6353f214378] and [#SRC:583731155e8d0cf1].",

    "gold_answer": "The definition operates in two linked steps that must be read together. Ordinarily, the minimum guarantee fund for long-term insurance business is determined by selecting the amount shown in column 2 of the relevant table, matched to the firm\u2019s highest annual contribution income for that business in any preceding financial year (with the income band identified in column 1) [#SRC:7add590aa50e6993]. However, that table-based approach depends on the existence of a preceding financial year from which the firm\u2019s highest annual contribution income can be identified.

In practice, this means a newly established firm (or one without a completed preceding financial year) does not attempt to infer or approximate a \u201chighest annual contribution income\u201d for table selection; instead, it applies the fixed \u00a390,000 minimum guarantee fund until it has a preceding financial year that enables the standard table correspondence to be used.",

    "gold_answer": "You need to apply two separate percentage limits that address different scopes, and both can matter for the same set of exposures.

    "gold_answer": "A firm that is a parent entity of an international group must demonstrate in its group recovery plan how it has covered the different entities in other jurisdictions, so the plan clearly addresses the wider group and not just a single entity or location [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41]. The PRA also expects the firm to understand dependencies between group entities, including both financial and non-financial dependencies, because these relationships can affect whether and how recovery actions can be carried out across the group [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41]. Alongside this, the firm must detail and explain the dependencies between recovery options and clearly identify where recovery options are mutually exclusive, so it is transparent which options rely on others and which options cannot be pursued at the same time [#SRC:21e8b786b13431f6]. In practice, the plan should therefore link the coverage of each relevant group entity (including those in other jurisdictions) with a clear explanation of how recovery options interact, so that the overall recovery approach is internally consistent and any constraints created by group-wide dependencies are explicitly set out [#SRC:21e8b786b13431f6] [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41].",

    "gold_answer": "The institution\u2019s starting point is that it has a time\u2011bound obligation to stop calculating exposure values for its derivative positions under the specified calculation approach within six months after a relevant trigger occurs [#SRC:e840f5f94a52b4e7]. Separately, the framework permits institutions to calculate one combined exposure value for all transactions covered by a contractual netting agreement, but only where all the stated conditions for that netting treatment are met [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. If those netting conditions are not met, the institution is not permitted to aggregate and instead must calculate an exposure value for each transaction on a standalone basis, with each transaction treated as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Read together, the permission to use a single exposure value under qualifying contractual netting does not remove or extend the separate requirement to cease the specified exposure\u2011value calculation method within the six\u2011month window; rather, it governs how exposure values may be determined (single netted value versus separate transaction values) in the circumstances where exposure values are being calculated [#SRC:e840f5f94a52b4e7] [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c].",

    "question": "When identity verification has not been completed under the relevant anti-money laundering requirements before the firm\u2019s compensation date, how should insolvency practitioners align their required consideration of their objectives and responsibilities with the ability for the relevant insolvency practitioner appointed by the court to facilitate identity verification to determine eligibility for FSCS protection?",
    "gold_answer": "Where identity verification has not been carried out in accordance with the relevant anti-money laundering requirements ahead of the firm\u2019s compensation date, the PRA\u2019s view is that the relevant insolvency practitioner appointed by the court is permitted to facilitate the identity verification specifically for the purpose of determining eligibility for FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme) protection [#SRC:eb355065b8865baf]. In parallel, insolvency practitioners are expected to consider matters in line with the insolvency practitioner\u2019s objectives and responsibilities under Section 99 of the Banking Act 2009 [#TGT:02363a43a51fdf7b]. Read together, this means the insolvency practitioner\u2019s decision-making should not treat facilitation of identity verification as a standalone discretionary step; rather, it should be approached as an action that may be used to support the eligibility determination where the pre-compensation-date verification gap exists, while ensuring the practitioner\u2019s overall approach remains consistent with their statutory objectives and responsibilities. The practical linkage is that the permitted facilitation addresses the missing verification needed to assess FSCS eligibility, and the required consideration frames how and why the practitioner proceeds in that context, given their role and responsibilities.",
    "generated_answer": "If AML identity verification has not been completed before the firm\u2019s compensation date, insolvency practitioners should still frame their actions around their statutory objectives and responsibilities under section 99 of the Banking Act 2009. [#ID:02363a43a51fdf7b] At the same time, the PRA view is that the relevant court-appointed insolvency practitioner may use Depositor Protection 2.2(4)(f) to facilitate completing identity verification after that point, specifically to assess whether a depositor is eligible for FSCS protection. [#ID:eb355065b8865baf] Practically, this means aligning decision-making with section 99 duties while enabling (rather than treating as barred) post-compensation-date verification where needed to determine FSCS eligibility.

    "question": "If an entity is required to determine the amount of the long-term insurance liability for each contract using a prospective calculation, can it nonetheless apply a retrospective calculation for certain contracts or benefits, and what evidentiary threshold must be met to justify that permission?",
    "gold_answer": "The baseline requirement is that the amount of the long-term insurance liability must be determined for each contract by a prospective calculation, which sets the expected method for liability measurement across the portfolio [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb]. The permission to use a retrospective calculation operates only as a constrained carve-out from that default and applies only to determine the liabilities in specific cases [#TGT:30f622a929df3844]. One route is functional impossibility: where a prospective method cannot be applied to a particular type of contract or benefit, a retrospective calculation may be applied for those liabilities notwithstanding the general prospective requirement [#TGT:30f622a929df3844] alongside [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb]. The other route is an evidentiary demonstration: the entity must be able to demonstrate that the resulting amount of liabilities from the retrospective calculation would be no lower than would be required by a prudent prospective calculation, meaning the retrospective result must not understate liabilities relative to a prudent prospective benchmark [#TGT:30f622a929df3844].",

The firm should therefore calibrate its downturn PPGD and downturn LGD assumptions so they are mutually consistent: the PPGD downturn property-value fall must at least meet the PRA\u2019s deflation floors, while the LGD framework should be anchored to the PRA\u2019s 40% peak-to-downturn sales-price reduction reference point and incorporate the forced-sale component described by the PRA.

    "gold_answer": "A person fits the definition if they are indebted to a society in respect of a loan that is fully secured on land, or, where the Rules so provide, substantially secured on land [#TGT:7856ac9ac9cb1882]. That matters because the permission on derivative investments is framed around limiting exposure to specified changes, including changes in the creditworthiness of any borrower(s) [#SRC:bf19a4f593cb137a]. So, if the society is considering derivatives to manage the risk that a borrower\u2019s ability to repay deteriorates, it should first confirm the borrower is indebted to the society under a qualifying land-secured loan as described in the definition. If that condition is met, the permission supports using derivative investments to limit the extent to which the society, its subsidiary undertaking, or a connected undertaking will be affected by that borrower creditworthiness change. The same permission also covers limiting impacts from interest rates, exchange rates, and certain price indices, but the borrower-creditworthiness link is the key connection to the defined land-secured indebtedness category.",

    "gold_answer": "The permitted asset exposure limits are defined by reference to the limits that are set out elsewhere, and an Authorised Person should treat those limits as the governing framework for what is permitted in relation to asset exposure [#SRC:4a2c6b4a1519f187]. Within that framework, a specific land-related exposure category is defined as 5% for a piece of land or a number of pieces of land (including one or more interests in such pieces of land) where, in the most recent proper valuation, an aggregate value is ascribed to the relevant pieces of land that is greater than the aggregate of the value of each piece of land or interest valued separately [#TGT:e0fdde5fe1fac33a]. Practically, this means the compliance assessment must (i) identify whether the asset exposure is to a \u201cpiece of land\u201d (or multiple pieces, or interests), (ii) confirm that the valuation used is the most recent proper valuation, and (iii) test whether the valuation methodology produces an aggregate value that exceeds the sum of separate valuations.

    "question": "When deciding what would generally be expected to be written down, what does the law treat as an excluded liability for amounts secured on property, and how does the PRA expect liabilities secured by floating charges to be handled in the creditor hierarchy?",
    "gold_answer": "To decide what would generally be expected to be written down, you need to combine the legal definition of excluded liabilities for secured amounts with the PRA\u2019s stated approach to write-down plans. Legally, an amount secured on property is treated as an excluded liability, but there is an important exception: if the security is a charge that, as created, was a floating charge, that secured amount is not treated as excluded on that basis (Section 377B(1)(d) of FSMA) [#TGT:8a41e3fa3a9296cc]. The PRA then explains how this plays out in practice: it recognises that liabilities secured by floating charges are not excluded liabilities and may therefore be written down, and it links this to avoiding an inappropriate and unintended priority for inward reinsurance creditors who often have floating charges but are contractually subordinated to rank alongside direct policyholders (who have a statutory priority) [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96]. As a result, where floating-charge liabilities are not subordinated in that way, the PRA says they would generally be expected to be written down only after lower-ranking liabilities, following the creditor hierarchy [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96].",

[#ID:8a41e3fa3a9296cc] The PRA expects write-down plans to broadly follow the creditor hierarchy to support better outcomes for policyholders and creditors overall. [#ID:3ab0329fffa4af96] Although liabilities secured by floating charges are not excluded and can be written down, the PRA\u2019s intent is to avoid giving floating-charge holders an unintended priority.

    "gold_answer": "The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) supervisory statement is framed as setting out the PRA\u2019s expectations for banks\u2019 model risk management (MRM), and it also makes clear that the PRA considers model risk to be a risk in its own right [#SRC:af03f7cbf472c97d].

At the same time, the use of \u201cbanks\u201d in the title is specifically intended to signal an exclusion: the expectations do not apply to insurers or reinsurers [#TGT:c120c182f73a34aa]. Accordingly, when applying the PRA\u2019s MRM expectations, firms should determine applicability by reference to the stated scope categories (banks, building societies, and designated investment firms) and should treat insurers and reinsurers as out of scope, even though the statement\u2019s title uses the term \u201cbanks\u201d [#SRC:af03f7cbf472c97d] [#TGT:c120c182f73a34aa].",

    "gold_answer": "Bonus payments may be used to equalise the reserves that a transferor society and a transferee society bring to the combined society, including (if thought desirable) paying a bonus to members of the transferee society so that the combined society\u2019s reserves are equalised at a level below the transferee society\u2019s capital ratio, but only where it is prudent to do so [#SRC:b67dac575cd27cc6]. However, implementing any such bonus arrangement requires members\u2019 approval as part of the Merger Resolutions [#TGT:9dfe512afd4bf0e8].

    "gold_answer": "A TWD firm can use the PRA\u2019s templates and accompanying instructions as the main reference point for what the PRA would expect the firm to be able to produce under the SS, because those materials are described as providing a guide to the breadth and granularity of the required data outputs [#TGT:13cf146179026c2c]. Template A (Appendix 1) helps the firm make that expectation more concrete by showing the kind of data breadth and detail that should be available to demonstrate a specific capability: analysing exit costs and liquidity flows. In doing so, Template A highlights that the firm should be able to segment the balance sheet by method and price of exit, which implies the firm\u2019s data production needs to support those breakdowns so the analysis can be performed in a structured way rather than at a single aggregated level [#SRC:87a878c6bb1a14e8].

    "gold_answer": "In determining whether a deposit falls within the scope of the rule that decides if it is an eligible deposit, a firm must apply the PRA\u2019s expectation that it takes reasonable steps to ascertain a local authority\u2019s annual budget, because that information is relevant to whether the local authority is eligible for the purposes of the eligibility determination [#TGT:02fb0fbf6939a082].

    "gold_answer": "The firm should use a data series of appropriate length so it can produce a reasonable estimate of the long-run default rate, rather than relying on an arbitrarily short or convenient window [#SRC:bbb89e949553ef1a]. For PDs that are long-run averages of one-year default rates for obligor grades or pools, the PRA expects the firm to estimate expected default rates over a representative mix of good and bad economic periods, instead of simply taking the historic average of default rates the firm actually incurred over a period of years [#TGT:13e5135f24e80eea]. This means the \u201cright\u201d length is the one that helps capture that representative mix, not just the number of years on hand. The PRA also expects that the long-run estimate should be changed when there is reason to believe the current estimate is no longer accurate, but it should not be automatically updated to add each new year of experience, because those additional years may not be representative of the long-run average [#TGT:13e5135f24e80eea].

    "gold_answer": "For CET1 and AT1, a firm must notify the PRA ahead of time when it intends to issue the instrument or when it intends to amend or vary its terms, as long as the instrument will count towards regulatory capital resources or own funds.

This matches the PRA Rulebook description that CET1 and AT1 issuances require pre-issuance notification [#TGT:b9bc12dacc3dd268]. Tier 2 is handled differently: instead of a one-month pre-notice, the firm must notify the PRA immediately after it issues a Tier 2 capital instrument, and immediately after it amends or varies the terms of a Tier 2 capital instrument, where it will count towards regulatory capital resources or own funds [#SRC:1fbc1202165b9d05].

    "gold_answer": "In this context, IFRS 9 is the accounting standard that sets the rules for accounting for financial instruments and replaces the earlier rules in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1]. The PRA expects firms to hold a larger buffer or strengthen their capital position where necessary, and it will also assess firms\u2019 capital positions under transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 until the end of 2023 where firms are using these arrangements [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7].

Putting these together, when the PRA assesses a firm\u2019s capital position under the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements through end-2023, the relevant accounting baseline is the IFRS 9 framework (issued July 2014; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018; replacing IAS 39) that governs financial instruments accounting [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1].",

    "gold_answer": "When assessing the appropriateness of any grouping of policies, the best estimate must still be calculated transparently and in a way that enables a qualified expert to review both the calculation method and the resulting outputs. This means the grouping approach cannot be treated as a purely administrative step; it must be integrated into the best estimate methodology so that an expert reviewer can understand how the grouping was selected, how it affects the calculation method, and how it influences the results.

    "gold_answer": "Firms that are parent entities of an international group must be able to show, within their group recovery plan, how they have covered the different entities located in other jurisdictions, rather than treating the plan as applying only to the parent or a single location [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41]. In doing so, the PRA expects firms to understand and reflect the dependencies between group entities, including both financial and non-financial dependencies, because these linkages affect how recovery actions can be executed across the group [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41]. Consistently, firms must detail and explain the dependencies between recovery options and clearly identify where recovery options are mutually exclusive, so that the plan makes clear which actions can be pursued together and which cannot be combined [#SRC:21e8b786b13431f6]. Taken together, this means the group recovery plan should connect entity coverage across jurisdictions with a clear mapping of option-to-option and entity-to-entity dependencies, enabling the PRA to assess whether proposed recovery actions are coherent across the international group and whether any constraints or incompatibilities have been explicitly identified [#SRC:21e8b786b13431f6] [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41].",

    "gold_answer": "A PRA-regulated firm must notify the PRA when it is entering into, or significantly changing, a material outsourcing arrangement, and the PRA expects the notification to be made before the firm enters into the outsourcing arrangement [#SRC:4feca3a835842f71].

    "gold_answer": "Yes. Once an SPF for restructuring becomes payable because a firm engages, or prepares to engage, in activity that involves it undertaking or making arrangements with a view to the specified outcomes, the payable amount must be calculated in a way that also captures certain external costs incurred by the PRA. The procedure says to add any fees and disbursements that a third party provider invoices to the PRA, but only where those charges are for services performed for the PRA and are connected to assisting the PRA in carrying out the relevant regulatory work. In other words, the trigger for payment is the firm\u2019s engagement (or preparation to engage) in the restructuring activity [#TGT:28f11ba870345a3b], and the calculation step requires including third\u2011party invoiced fees and disbursements to the PRA that relate to supporting the PRA\u2019s performance of that regulatory work [#SRC:f9e22b9441fa0c58].",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The FSCS must reimburse interest owed on eligible deposits where the interest had accrued but had not been credited at the compensation date, except where the compensation sum arises from a temporary high balance [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f]. However, paying that interest does not increase the depositor\u2019s compensation beyond the maximum compensation sum payable for the depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits. The definition sets that maximum at \u00a3120,000 for each depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits, while also noting that additional compensation may be payable in certain cases [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e]. The interest reimbursement is therefore required, but it is capped: the FSCS must ensure that the payment of accrued-but-uncredited interest does not cause the depositor\u2019s compensation to exceed the maximum compensation sum [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f], as that maximum is defined for the depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e].

The \u201cnet income\u201d component used as the numerator is not left to general interpretation; it is specifically tied to a FINREP data point, meaning net income must be taken from row 355, column 01 of template F02.00 (FINREP) [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4]. Read together, this means the RoA numerator must be sourced from that precise FINREP location for each year included in the two-year averaging window, while the denominator remains total assets as required by the RoA calculation construct [#SRC:005b0d8588b51505]. Accordingly, compliance hinges on (i) using the FINREP-defined net income figure as the numerator and (ii) applying it in the ratio to total assets, with the resulting annual ratios then averaged over two years, ensuring the same definitional basis for net income throughout [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4].",

    "question": "If a derivative transaction has more than one material risk driver and must be mapped to more than one risk category, how does an institution decide whether it is long or short in the most material risk driver for each risk category, using the rule about when the transaction\u2019s market value increases?",
    "gold_answer": "An institution must map a derivative transaction that has more than one material risk driver to more than one risk category, unless all of the transaction\u2019s material risk drivers are in the same risk category, in which case it maps the transaction only once to that single category using the most material risk driver [#TGT:28d975e9bccdd9ad]. If the material risk drivers span different risk categories, the institution maps the transaction once to each relevant risk category, and for each category it uses the most material risk driver within that category as the basis for mapping [#TGT:28d975e9bccdd9ad]. After that, the institution determines whether its position in the primary risk driver or most material risk driver (for the given risk category) is long or short by checking how the transaction\u2019s market value reacts when that risk driver\u2019s value increases: market value increasing implies a long position, while market value decreasing implies a short position [#SRC:c6e60ca38b4dc301]. This means the long/short assessment is tied to the specific most material risk driver used for each mapped risk category.",
    "generated_answer": "For a derivative with multiple material risk drivers mapped to multiple risk categories, the institution determines long/short separately within each mapped risk category by focusing on that category\u2019s most material risk driver.

    "gold_answer": "If a pooled asset exposure\u2019s underlying assets are exposed to economic risks, and the firm has enough evidence that the exposure is predictable, the firm may propose to apply the standard approach to the FS addition for event risks [#SRC:957d2122eefbf855]. In doing so, the firm should define the relevant event risk in the way the PRA characterises it: event-driven cash flow variability risks are more likely to be appropriately represented using fatter-tailed distributions, meaning the firm should not assume that event impacts on cash flows are narrowly distributed around the average [#TGT:24cba8bb8769696c]. Where more complete credible data becomes available to support more sophisticated modelling, the PRA links this definition to a practical benchmark for provision: a provision equal to one quarter of the difference in MA benefit from median to worst cash flows is described as broadly equivalent to targeting the 85th percentile of a fatter-tailed distribution, and this would likely demonstrate adequate provision for the additional retained cash flow variability risks [#TGT:24cba8bb8769696c].

Then, when you encounter drafting that uses the Euro as an example of a currency, you should check whether the provision applies the same treatment to other currencies (for example, US dollars).

Operationally, this means you document that the Euro reference is illustrative, confirm equivalence of treatment across currencies, and continue applying the Table A default interpretation without modification.

    "question": "If a firm holds assets with HP cash flows in its MA portfolio, what must it do to find all the cash flow timing/amount uncertainties and make sure the extra risks from cash flow variability are properly covered in the FS, and what does the PRA expect the firm to write down?",
    "gold_answer": "If a firm includes assets with HP cash flows in its MA portfolio, it must recognise that these assets are likely to add extra risk and therefore increases to the FS for these assets will be required to provision for those additional risks [#TGT:a84f9442b495f121]. The firm must also identify all sources of uncertainty in cash flow timing and/or amount and make an adequate allowance for those uncertainties, so that the FS outcome reflects the full set of relevant uncertainties rather than only a subset [#TGT:a84f9442b495f121]. Alongside this, the firm should consider additional risks that arise from sources of cash flow variability and ensure that these risks have been sufficiently captured by the required FS additions, using the guidance referenced in the source passage to support that assessment [#SRC:b728c6d47d520ce6]. The PRA expects the firm to document the details of the sources of uncertainty it has identified and to document how it has allowed for them, providing a clear record that the FS increases and other FS additions are grounded in the firm\u2019s identified variability and uncertainty drivers [#TGT:a84f9442b495f121].",

    "gold_answer": "A TWD firm must be able to refresh the material components of the TWD option within weeks through a \u201cfull plan refresh,\u201d which includes updating the assumptions and approximations that inform the TWD option, updating the modelling or methodology used for information provision and decision-making, and updating the factors that make up the TWD scenario [#SRC:76a8dbf9e47fc1dd]. To decide what is in scope for that refresh, material components are those where the impact of a change could influence decision-making, and TWD firms must define what they mean by \u201cmaterial component\u201d and set thresholds for what level of change is treated as material [#TGT:8d564dede4742c2a]. In practice, the firm\u2019s definitions and thresholds provide the consistent trigger points for identifying decision-relevant changes and ensuring they are captured in the full plan refresh within the required weeks-long timeframe, rather than being handled ad hoc or inconsistently across different assumptions, methods, or scenario drivers.",

    "question": "What does \u201csleeper collateral\u201d mean for an insurer, and why is it relevant when counterparties or other market participants create liquidity stress by recalling it or triggering collateral posting issues?",
    "gold_answer": "For an insurer, \u201csleeper collateral\u201d means the value of collateral the insurer is already contractually required to post to a counterparty, but has not actually posted yet because the counterparty has not called for it [#TGT:17e755beec91fb74]. It becomes relevant in liquidity-stress analysis because the source describes how actions of counterparties and other market participants can create liquidity stresses that adversely affect the insurer, including by recalling sleeper collateral, by situations where collateral required is not posted, or by opening valuation disputes [#SRC:4fbd64abc69cb404]. In practical terms, the definition clarifies that sleeper collateral is not \u201coptional\u201d collateral; it is an existing obligation that is simply untriggered until a call occurs. Under the stressed conditions described, a call or recall can rapidly turn that unposted obligation into a near-term liquidity need, potentially alongside market price impacts from other participants selling similar assets the insurer may rely on for liquidity.",
