    "question": "When a firm is investing in assets covering technical provisions for linked long-term contracts of insurance, in what circumstances must it still apply the PRA\u2019s expectation to limit its investment where there is insufficient data to quantify asset risks, and when is that expectation outside scope?",
    "gold_answer": "The PRA\u2019s expectation that a firm should limit its investment appropriately where there is insufficient data to quantify the risks arises when the firm is considering the nature and quantification of risks for each category of asset and for individual assets [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8]. However, the scope of the relevant part of the chapter is restricted for firms investing in assets that cover technical provisions (TPs) for linked long-term contracts of insurance: those provisions do not apply to such firms, except in a specific carve-in [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. The carve-in is where the assets are held to cover the additional TPs in respect of policyholder liabilities, including liabilities for any guarantee of investment performance or other guaranteed benefit provided under those linked long-term contracts [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. Accordingly, the firm should treat the expectation to limit investment due to insufficient risk data as applicable when the assets fall within that exception (ie, held for additional TPs tied to policyholder liabilities and guarantees), and as not applicable under this chapter where the assets merely cover TPs for linked long-term contracts without meeting the exception [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6] [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8].",
    "generated_answer": "A firm should still follow the PRA\u2019s expectation to constrain investment whenever it cannot adequately quantify the risks of an asset category or a specific asset, including when assessing risks for assets covering technical provisions.

    "question": "If a credit union is expected by the PRA to follow concentration limits because it is over \u00a310 million in assets or holds certain investments, do those limits still apply when money is only sitting in an account for a short time before an investment decision is made?",
    "gold_answer": "Reading the two statements together, the PRA sets an expectation that certain credit unions should adhere to concentration limits: specifically, credit unions with more than \u00a310 million in total assets and any credit unions that hold investments that fall under the referenced Rules, with an additional note that there are exceptions for certain listed investments. At the same time, the PRA also explains that the limits are not intended to apply in a particular, narrow situation\u2014where funds are held temporarily in an account before an investment decision is made. So, even if a credit union is within the group the PRA expects to follow the concentration limits, it can treat those limits as not applying to money that is merely parked on a short-term basis while the credit union has not yet decided how to invest it. The key boundary is the purpose and timing of the holding: the carve-out is tied to pre-decision, temporary holding, whereas the expectation to adhere to concentration limits is directed at credit unions meeting the asset-size or investment-holding conditions, subject to the separate investment exceptions. [#SRC:960de0d328d37ad1] [#TGT:6cdd849d0a0503ce]",
    "generated_answer": "No. The PRA indicates that the concentration limits it expects certain credit unions to follow (including those with more than \u00a310 million in total assets or holding specified investments) are not intended to capture funds that are only parked briefly pending an investment decision.

    "question": "When an Institution is permitted to compute one exposure value across transactions under a contractual netting agreement (subject to the relevant conditions), what must it do in terms of notifying the competent authorities about the calculation method it uses or ceases to use for determining exposure values for derivative positions?",
    "gold_answer": "Where Institutions choose to calculate exposure values for derivative positions using a particular method, they have a notification duty: they shall notify the competent authorities of the methods they use, or cease to use, to calculate the exposure value of their derivative positions [#SRC:7085c26bac1b91bb]. That obligation applies alongside the permission in the netting context: Institutions may calculate a single exposure value for all transactions within a contractual netting agreement only where the specified conditions are met; if those conditions are not met, Institutions must instead calculate an exposure value separately for each transaction, treating each transaction as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Practically, this means that whenever an Institution adopts (or stops using) a method to support either (i) a single exposure value approach for transactions within a contractual netting agreement, or (ii) separate exposure value calculations per transaction, it must notify the competent authorities of the relevant method change or continued use. The notification requirement is framed around the methods used to calculate exposure values, not around the netting permission itself, so Institutions should ensure their notifications align with the method(s) actually applied to the exposure value calculations in either scenario.",

    "question": "After a liability is first recorded, must a firm (and an insurance or reinsurance undertaking) avoid changing the valuation just because its own credit standing changes?",
    "gold_answer": "Yes. The TARGET sets a two-step requirement for a firm: it must value financial liabilities (as referred to in UK-adopted international accounting standards) in the required way when the liability is first recognised, and then it must not make any later adjustment that takes account of a change in the firm\u2019s own credit standing after that initial recognition [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6]. The SOURCE expresses the same type of restriction for a different actor and in a \u201csubsequently\u201d context: it states that there shall be no valuation adjustment to take account of the change in own credit standing of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking [#SRC:d6c3553c96db7f71]. Taken together, the practical rule is consistent across both texts: once the liability valuation is established at the relevant recognition point, later movements in the entity\u2019s own credit standing are not a permitted reason to adjust the valuation. The main difference is only who is being addressed (a firm versus an insurance or reinsurance undertaking) and the explicit linkage in the TARGET to initial recognition and subsequent adjustments.",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. Even if there are amounts that the FSCS has not been able to recover from DGS members as a result of the relevant levy outcomes described in the source, the FSCS is still constrained by the rule that sets a maximum annual amount of DGS compensation costs it can levy on DGS members [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380].

The unrecovered-amounts situation explains that some sums may remain unpaid or uncollected from DGS members, but it does not itself authorize the FSCS to exceed the cap [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380]. The only stated way the FSCS can levy more than the cap is if there are exceptional circumstances and the FSCS has the prior consent of the PRA; without that consent (and without exceptional circumstances), charging above the cap is prohibited [#TGT:ba641d05400bc860].",
    "generated_answer": "Yes.

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The reduction is required to be carried out by making a deduction from the aggregate value of the assets that the firm would otherwise be permitted to take into account for the relevant purposes.

At the same time, the firm\u2019s aggregate value of assets must be reduced by an amount that represents the aggregate of specified components, and that obligation applies subject to the related provisions that frame how the reduction operates. Putting both requirements together, the firm must first identify the reduction amount as the aggregate of the relevant items, and then implement that reduction by deducting that amount from the aggregate asset value it would otherwise be allowed to include.

    "gold_answer": "The definition operates in two linked steps that must be read together.

However, that table-based approach depends on the existence of a preceding financial year from which the firm\u2019s highest annual contribution income can be identified.

    "gold_answer": "You need to apply two separate percentage limits that address different scopes, and both can matter for the same set of exposures.

    "question": "When the Merger Document(s) are sent out with a covering letter, what exactly are the proxy voting forms meant to be, and what are they used for at a society meeting?",
    "gold_answer": "The proxy voting forms that may be included as \u201cother documents\u201d alongside a covering letter for the Merger Document(s) are not just generic voting papers; they are the formal instrument used to appoint a proxy. Their purpose is to let a member name someone else to attend a meeting of a society and vote for the member. So, in the merger materials package, the covering letter is an accompanying document, and the proxy voting forms are the mechanism that enables members who cannot attend to still participate through a proxy\u2019s attendance and voting. This connection matters because the source indicates that proxy voting forms can be part of the documents provided with the Merger Document(s) [#SRC:81e3009351497661], and the target clarifies the meaning and function of that proxy instrument: it appoints a proxy to attend the society meeting and vote on the member\u2019s behalf [#TGT:075179a0e3b09cfe].",

[#ID:81e3009351497661] The society\u2019s proxy voting process is normally set out in its Rules, and any proxy form issued must allow the member to specify how the proxy should vote. [#ID:bec1c6406d0334b7] The PRA considers it good practice to include proxy forms with the meeting notice for a merger to avoid any perception that members were discouraged from voting or had to request forms.

    "gold_answer": "The requirement is that a firm must monitor and, on a regular basis, evaluate whether its systems, internal control mechanisms and arrangements are adequate and effective, and then take appropriate measures to address any deficiencies, but this duty is tied to the systems and arrangements established in accordance with the Chapter [#TGT:0b5d0c9bc5e714bd].

Outside that extent, the scope limitation means the firm is not required, for those benchmarking activities, to maintain and review systems and controls under this Chapter in the way described [#TGT:0b5d0c9bc5e714bd].",
    "generated_answer": "Based on the passages, the regular \u201ccheck, test, and remediate\u201d obligation is not clearly stated, but the general position is that the relevant provisions may not apply to benchmarking activities unless they were originally made (before IP completion day) to implement an EU instrument. [#4583db85bf9943ef] In particular, provisions 2.1 to 2.8 are disapplied for firms carrying on benchmarking activities, except to the limited extent tied to pre\u2011IP completion day EU\u2011transposition purposes.

To satisfy the PRA\u2019s expectation, the internal audit function should therefore review how the firm is involved in the transaction (in its capacity as originator, original lender, and/or sponsor) and also verify, based on the transaction\u2019s underlying exposures, that no securitisation positions are included. This links the internal audit assurance obligation about the firm\u2019s compliant involvement [#SRC:cecc17757525a70b] with the specific prohibited feature of the securitisation\u2019s exposure composition [#TGT:d7fccee9ffee99cb].",

The PRA also expects the firm to understand dependencies between group entities, including both financial and non-financial dependencies, because these relationships can affect whether and how recovery actions can be carried out across the group [#TGT:87b9b2ff210e1f41]. Alongside this, the firm must detail and explain the dependencies between recovery options and clearly identify where recovery options are mutually exclusive, so it is transparent which options rely on others and which options cannot be pursued at the same time [#SRC:21e8b786b13431f6].

If those netting conditions are not met, the institution is not permitted to aggregate and instead must calculate an exposure value for each transaction on a standalone basis, with each transaction treated as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Read together, the permission to use a single exposure value under qualifying contractual netting does not remove or extend the separate requirement to cease the specified exposure\u2011value calculation method within the six\u2011month window; rather, it governs how exposure values may be determined (single netted value versus separate transaction values) in the circumstances where exposure values are being calculated [#SRC:e840f5f94a52b4e7] [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c].",

Under the TARGET, Subject to 2.3 and 2.4, a credit union must ensure that a member does not have non-deferred shares in the credit union which in aggregate exceed the greater of the applicable limit.

    "question": "When identity verification has not been completed under the relevant anti-money laundering requirements before the firm\u2019s compensation date, how should insolvency practitioners align their required consideration of their objectives and responsibilities with the ability for the relevant insolvency practitioner appointed by the court to facilitate identity verification to determine eligibility for FSCS protection?",
    "gold_answer": "Where identity verification has not been carried out in accordance with the relevant anti-money laundering requirements ahead of the firm\u2019s compensation date, the PRA\u2019s view is that the relevant insolvency practitioner appointed by the court is permitted to facilitate the identity verification specifically for the purpose of determining eligibility for FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme) protection [#SRC:eb355065b8865baf]. In parallel, insolvency practitioners are expected to consider matters in line with the insolvency practitioner\u2019s objectives and responsibilities under Section 99 of the Banking Act 2009 [#TGT:02363a43a51fdf7b]. Read together, this means the insolvency practitioner\u2019s decision-making should not treat facilitation of identity verification as a standalone discretionary step; rather, it should be approached as an action that may be used to support the eligibility determination where the pre-compensation-date verification gap exists, while ensuring the practitioner\u2019s overall approach remains consistent with their statutory objectives and responsibilities. The practical linkage is that the permitted facilitation addresses the missing verification needed to assess FSCS eligibility, and the required consideration frames how and why the practitioner proceeds in that context, given their role and responsibilities.",
    "generated_answer": "If AML identity verification is still incomplete before the firm\u2019s compensation date, insolvency practitioners should treat their objectives and responsibilities as compatible with enabling verification to proceed after that date, rather than as a barrier to determining compensation eligibility. [#eb355065b8865baf] The PRA\u2019s view is that the relevant rule permits the court-appointed insolvency practitioner to facilitate identity verification specifically to assess whether a depositor qualifies for FSCS protection.

    "gold_answer": "The baseline requirement is that the amount of the long-term insurance liability must be determined for each contract by a prospective calculation, which sets the expected method for liability measurement across the portfolio [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb]. The permission to use a retrospective calculation operates only as a constrained carve-out from that default and applies only to determine the liabilities in specific cases [#TGT:30f622a929df3844]. One route is functional impossibility: where a prospective method cannot be applied to a particular type of contract or benefit, a retrospective calculation may be applied for those liabilities notwithstanding the general prospective requirement [#TGT:30f622a929df3844] alongside [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb]. The other route is an evidentiary demonstration: the entity must be able to demonstrate that the resulting amount of liabilities from the retrospective calculation would be no lower than would be required by a prudent prospective calculation, meaning the retrospective result must not understate liabilities relative to a prudent prospective benchmark [#TGT:30f622a929df3844].",

The firm should therefore calibrate its downturn PPGD and downturn LGD assumptions so they are mutually consistent: the PPGD downturn property-value fall must at least meet the PRA\u2019s deflation floors, while the LGD framework should be anchored to the PRA\u2019s 40% peak-to-downturn sales-price reduction reference point and incorporate the forced-sale component described by the PRA.

    "gold_answer": "A person fits the definition if they are indebted to a society in respect of a loan that is fully secured on land, or, where the Rules so provide, substantially secured on land [#TGT:7856ac9ac9cb1882]. That matters because the permission on derivative investments is framed around limiting exposure to specified changes, including changes in the creditworthiness of any borrower(s) [#SRC:bf19a4f593cb137a]. So, if the society is considering derivatives to manage the risk that a borrower\u2019s ability to repay deteriorates, it should first confirm the borrower is indebted to the society under a qualifying land-secured loan as described in the definition. If that condition is met, the permission supports using derivative investments to limit the extent to which the society, its subsidiary undertaking, or a connected undertaking will be affected by that borrower creditworthiness change. The same permission also covers limiting impacts from interest rates, exchange rates, and certain price indices, but the borrower-creditworthiness link is the key connection to the defined land-secured indebtedness category.",

    "gold_answer": "The permitted asset exposure limits are defined by reference to the limits that are set out elsewhere, and an Authorised Person should treat those limits as the governing framework for what is permitted in relation to asset exposure [#SRC:4a2c6b4a1519f187]. Within that framework, a specific land-related exposure category is defined as 5% for a piece of land or a number of pieces of land (including one or more interests in such pieces of land) where, in the most recent proper valuation, an aggregate value is ascribed to the relevant pieces of land that is greater than the aggregate of the value of each piece of land or interest valued separately [#TGT:e0fdde5fe1fac33a]. Practically, this means the compliance assessment must (i) identify whether the asset exposure is to a \u201cpiece of land\u201d (or multiple pieces, or interests), (ii) confirm that the valuation used is the most recent proper valuation, and (iii) test whether the valuation methodology produces an aggregate value that exceeds the sum of separate valuations.

    "question": "When deciding what would generally be expected to be written down, what does the law treat as an excluded liability for amounts secured on property, and how does the PRA expect liabilities secured by floating charges to be handled in the creditor hierarchy?",
    "gold_answer": "To decide what would generally be expected to be written down, you need to combine the legal definition of excluded liabilities for secured amounts with the PRA\u2019s stated approach to write-down plans. Legally, an amount secured on property is treated as an excluded liability, but there is an important exception: if the security is a charge that, as created, was a floating charge, that secured amount is not treated as excluded on that basis (Section 377B(1)(d) of FSMA) [#TGT:8a41e3fa3a9296cc]. The PRA then explains how this plays out in practice: it recognises that liabilities secured by floating charges are not excluded liabilities and may therefore be written down, and it links this to avoiding an inappropriate and unintended priority for inward reinsurance creditors who often have floating charges but are contractually subordinated to rank alongside direct policyholders (who have a statutory priority) [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96]. As a result, where floating-charge liabilities are not subordinated in that way, the PRA says they would generally be expected to be written down only after lower-ranking liabilities, following the creditor hierarchy [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96].",

[#ID:3ab0329fffa4af96] Although liabilities secured by floating charges can be written down, the PRA\u2019s intent is to avoid giving floating-charge holders (often inward reinsurance creditors) an unintended priority over policyholders and other creditors.

After you have those dependant exposure results, you then adjust the firm\u2019s own exposure figure: the amount of the firm\u2019s exposure to the relevant assets (as determined under the same provisions) must be increased by an additional amount that represents the exposure, if any, of the firm\u2019s dependants to assets of that description [#SRC:250709f3ef53e2f6]. So the sequence is: calculate the firm\u2019s exposure under the provisions, calculate each dependant\u2019s exposure using the same method-as-if-a-firm approach, and then add an increment to the firm\u2019s exposure equal to the dependant exposure amount(s), but only where dependant exposure exists.",

    "gold_answer": "The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) supervisory statement is framed as setting out the PRA\u2019s expectations for banks\u2019 model risk management (MRM), and it also makes clear that the PRA considers model risk to be a risk in its own right [#SRC:af03f7cbf472c97d].

At the same time, the use of \u201cbanks\u201d in the title is specifically intended to signal an exclusion: the expectations do not apply to insurers or reinsurers [#TGT:c120c182f73a34aa].

    "gold_answer": "If a firm holds assets with cash flows whose timing is uncertain but bounded (for example, where redemption or the start of repayments can vary within a contractually bounded period), the firm should consider whether those assets meet the criteria for HP cash flows and, if they do, it may include them in the MA portfolio within the limited proportion allowed for such assets [#SRC:e9aa8247582c38d4].

    "gold_answer": "A firm may be permitted not to comply with certain requirements where, in view of the nature, scale and complexity of its business and the nature and range of the relevant services and activities, compliance would not be proportionate, provided that the firm\u2019s compliance function is, and continues to be, effective [#SRC:029ad42316e71977]. Even where that permission applies, the firm remains subject to an overarching obligation to ensure that the compliance function is able to discharge its responsibilities properly and independently [#TGT:56dd025c30f9e7e2]. Read together, this means the firm cannot treat the proportionality-based non-compliance as a relaxation of the need for an effective compliance function; rather, it must maintain arrangements that support proper and independent performance of the compliance function\u2019s responsibilities while also ensuring the function remains effective on an ongoing basis. The firm should therefore assess proportionality in light of its business and activities, and only rely on the permission if it can demonstrate continuing effectiveness of the compliance function alongside the required ability for that function to operate properly and independently [#SRC:029ad42316e71977] [#TGT:56dd025c30f9e7e2].",

    "gold_answer": "A TWD firm can use the PRA\u2019s templates and accompanying instructions as the main reference point for what the PRA would expect the firm to be able to produce under the SS, because those materials are described as providing a guide to the breadth and granularity of the required data outputs [#TGT:13cf146179026c2c]. Template A (Appendix 1) helps the firm make that expectation more concrete by showing the kind of data breadth and detail that should be available to demonstrate a specific capability: analysing exit costs and liquidity flows. In doing so, Template A highlights that the firm should be able to segment the balance sheet by method and price of exit, which implies the firm\u2019s data production needs to support those breakdowns so the analysis can be performed in a structured way rather than at a single aggregated level [#SRC:87a878c6bb1a14e8].

    "gold_answer": "In determining whether a deposit falls within the scope of the rule that decides if it is an eligible deposit, a firm must apply the PRA\u2019s expectation that it takes reasonable steps to ascertain a local authority\u2019s annual budget, because that information is relevant to whether the local authority is eligible for the purposes of the eligibility determination [#TGT:02fb0fbf6939a082].

A low turnout by itself does not automatically mean the criterion is met; the PRA must look at turnout alongside other criteria and other factors that may have affected participation [#TGT:2dd0fc894f17de97]. In that context, if the number of invalid votes appears significant, the PRA would find it helpful for the scrutineers report to explain what went wrong in the process (any procedural difficulties) and to give an analysis of the reasons why votes were found invalid, rather than simply listing a number [#SRC:2c0f6dd7f7e57586]. This matters because the scrutineers report is one of the inputs the PRA considers on the conduct and counting of votes, including the number of and reasons for invalid proxy votes, which can help show whether members had adequate facilities and opportunity to vote and whether the recorded result is likely to reflect members\u2019 views [#TGT:2dd0fc894f17de97].",

This means the grouping approach cannot be treated as a purely administrative step; it must be integrated into the best estimate methodology so that an expert reviewer can understand how the grouping was selected, how it affects the calculation method, and how it influences the results.

    "gold_answer": "An institution is allowed to calculate a single exposure value at netting set level for all transactions covered by a contractual netting agreement, but only if it meets the conditions attached to that permission [#TGT:1600c3275d4f97ef]. Separately, the rules on permanently combining the relevant methods draw a line between group use and single-institution use: institutions may combine those methods on a permanent basis within a group, but a single institution must not combine them on a permanent basis [#SRC:05cc39f7a09a2d78]. Putting these together, the netting-set exposure value permission does not remove the prohibition on permanent method-combination for a single institution. So, an institution may be able to compute one exposure value for the netting set if the contractual netting agreement conditions are met [#TGT:1600c3275d4f97ef], but if it is acting as a single institution it still cannot permanently mix the relevant methods; that permanent mixing is only allowed when done within a group [#SRC:05cc39f7a09a2d78].",

    "gold_answer": "An insurer must design and use its risk monitoring metrics in a way that directly supports how it determines, maintains, and evidences any liquidity buffer(s) it holds, because those metrics are part of the framework used to size and track liquid resources against expected outflows [#SRC:9c279e6bff2a8352]. In parallel, the insurer is required to invest in assets that ensure the liquidity of its investment portfolio and to consider whether its assets are appropriate to meet obligations as they fall due, which includes considering total liquidity needs and the level and monitoring of liquid assets [#TGT:69f861caa7c533e0]. Practically, this means the insurer\u2019s metrics should be capable of monitoring liquid assets and informing decisions about an appropriate liquidity buffer, including under stressed conditions, so the insurer can demonstrate it maintains an adequate stock of liquid assets sufficient to meet liabilities as they fall due [#TGT:69f861caa7c533e0].

Once an SPF for restructuring becomes payable because a firm engages, or prepares to engage, in activity that involves it undertaking or making arrangements with a view to the specified outcomes, the payable amount must be calculated in a way that also captures certain external costs incurred by the PRA. The procedure says to add any fees and disbursements that a third party provider invoices to the PRA, but only where those charges are for services performed for the PRA and are connected to assisting the PRA in carrying out the relevant regulatory work. In other words, the trigger for payment is the firm\u2019s engagement (or preparation to engage) in the restructuring activity [#TGT:28f11ba870345a3b], and the calculation step requires including third\u2011party invoiced fees and disbursements to the PRA that relate to supporting the PRA\u2019s performance of that regulatory work [#SRC:f9e22b9441fa0c58].",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The FSCS must reimburse interest owed on eligible deposits where the interest had accrued but had not been credited at the compensation date, except where the compensation sum arises from a temporary high balance [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f]. However, paying that interest does not increase the depositor\u2019s compensation beyond the maximum compensation sum payable for the depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits. The definition sets that maximum at \u00a3120,000 for each depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits, while also noting that additional compensation may be payable in certain cases [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e]. The interest reimbursement is therefore required, but it is capped: the FSCS must ensure that the payment of accrued-but-uncredited interest does not cause the depositor\u2019s compensation to exceed the maximum compensation sum [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f], as that maximum is defined for the depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e].

The \u201cnet income\u201d component used as the numerator is not left to general interpretation; it is specifically tied to a FINREP data point, meaning net income must be taken from row 355, column 01 of template F02.00 (FINREP) [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4]. Read together, this means the RoA numerator must be sourced from that precise FINREP location for each year included in the two-year averaging window, while the denominator remains total assets as required by the RoA calculation construct [#SRC:005b0d8588b51505]. Accordingly, compliance hinges on (i) using the FINREP-defined net income figure as the numerator and (ii) applying it in the ratio to total assets, with the resulting annual ratios then averaged over two years, ensuring the same definitional basis for net income throughout [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4].",

    "gold_answer": "An institution must map a derivative transaction that has more than one material risk driver to more than one risk category, unless all of the transaction\u2019s material risk drivers are in the same risk category, in which case it maps the transaction only once to that single category using the most material risk driver [#TGT:28d975e9bccdd9ad].

After that, the institution determines whether its position in the primary risk driver or most material risk driver (for the given risk category) is long or short by checking how the transaction\u2019s market value reacts when that risk driver\u2019s value increases: market value increasing implies a long position, while market value decreasing implies a short position [#SRC:c6e60ca38b4dc301].

    "gold_answer": "Scenario testing should be used to connect two complementary objectives: (1) selecting the subset of options that would likely be chosen to respond to specific stresses, and (2) demonstrating that the recovery plan is suitable across a range of different types of stress while showing how plan elements interact under those stresses. Practically, the scenario design should require the recovery plan to identify, for each specific stress, which options are realistically expected to be selected (i.e., a subset rather than an exhaustive list), and then use those selections as the basis for testing the plan\u2019s operation in that stress. The testing should explicitly examine how the chosen options work alongside other elements of the plan\u2014such as indicators and governance\u2014to show whether the plan functions coherently when pressures vary in type and severity. This approach ensures the scenario exercise is not merely theoretical, but instead focuses on likely decision pathways and their operational implications, while still supporting the broader demonstration that the recovery plan can be used in multiple stress conditions and that its components interact as intended [#SRC:db5203b384a28349] [#TGT:3cc3932a984e4450].",

Where more complete credible data becomes available to support more sophisticated modelling, the PRA links this definition to a practical benchmark for provision: a provision equal to one quarter of the difference in MA benefit from median to worst cash flows is described as broadly equivalent to targeting the 85th percentile of a fatter-tailed distribution, and this would likely demonstrate adequate provision for the additional retained cash flow variability risks [#TGT:24cba8bb8769696c].

    "gold_answer": "The qualifying shareholding date is defined by reference to the voting date: it is either the last day of the financial year immediately preceding the voting date, or\u2014where the voting date falls after the conclusion of the society\u2019s AGM commenced in that financial year\u2014the first day of the period that begins 56 days before the meeting date [#TGT:8b090799d8ee6d60]. That definition sets the date (or period) against which any shareholding condition must be tested for voting entitlement on a shareholding members resolution. However, when assessing whether a person meets a requirement for holding shares on that qualifying date (or during any required period), the person is prohibited from relying on a share account that has an overdrawn balance; such an overdrawn share account cannot be used to satisfy a shareholding requirement on a given date or during a given period [#SRC:5292b5d19dc62407]. Accordingly, even if the qualifying shareholding date is correctly identified under the definition, the underlying shareholding must be genuine and not merely an overdrawn account position, because that would not meet the holding-shares requirement for the relevant date or period.",

    "gold_answer": "For an insurer, \u201csleeper collateral\u201d means the value of collateral the insurer is already contractually required to post to a counterparty, but has not actually posted yet because the counterparty has not called for it [#TGT:17e755beec91fb74].

In practical terms, the definition clarifies that sleeper collateral is not \u201coptional\u201d collateral; it is an existing obligation that is simply untriggered until a call occurs. Under the stressed conditions described, a call or recall can rapidly turn that unposted obligation into a near-term liquidity need, potentially alongside market price impacts from other participants selling similar assets the insurer may rely on for liquidity.",
