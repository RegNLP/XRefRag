This matters because poor capital management is described as a common issue for new and growing banks, including waiting until the last minute to secure the investment needed to keep operating without entering capital buffers [#TGT:0b17ba9a4e4a6431]. When investment is delayed, a bank can end up entering its capital buffers in the normal course of business, which is not aligned with PRA policy, or it may have to raise extra capital under difficult conditions.

So the credible plan is not just about having access to capital in theory; it is about timing and certainty so capital is available before buffers are threatened.", "source_text": "New and growing banks are often loss making initially and rely on regular capital injections to maintain their capital adequacy. The PRA understands this is often a feature of new businesses, but it is of course not sustainable over the longer term and creates a vulnerability to capital not being available when needed. Banks should focus on reaching profitability and the ability to achieve organic capital generation within a reasonable time period following authorisation, recognising that the longer they are unprofitable, the more uncertainty there is about whether investor sentiment will remain positive. By around three years post-authorisation, the PRA expects banks to have more clarity over their path to profitability. By five years post-authorisation, banks should either be profitable or have a credible strategy to achieve profitability, with definite capital support to achieve this. If the firm is of a size to require minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) at greater than minimum capital requirements within this planning horizon, it needs to factor in those requirements (see paragraph 4.4 ). The PRA, however, recognises that a number of factors, including the nature of the business model, could impact the path to profitability, and will apply flexibility in exceptional circumstances where the path to profitability is credible and there is sufficient financial resources in place in advance to manage the risks around that path. At least until profitability is achieved, the PRA expects firms to have a credible capital plan which will ensure new capital is injected in good time to avoid capital requirements plus buffers being entered.

In effect, the governance and decision-making framework must include an embedded communication and awareness component: relevant persons should be informed of the applicable procedures and understand that those procedures must be followed when carrying out their responsibilities. The firm’s governance arrangements and decision-making procedures therefore need to be established and implemented with sufficient clarity and accessibility to support proper discharge of responsibilities, and maintained so that awareness does not lapse as roles or circumstances change.

Accordingly, the credit union should treat the 10% threshold as a baseline within its broader, continuing assessment of how much liquidity it needs and what form that liquidity should take, ensuring that its maintained liquid asset position remains at or above the minimum relative to total relevant liabilities while also addressing the quality dimension referenced in its ongoing maintenance obligation [#SRC:f2622a90a592c4ce] and the specific percentage requirement [#TGT:738a19e25819dedf].", "source_text": "the quantity and quality of liquid assets to be maintained by the credit union over time, taking into account the minimum liquidity requirements in Rule 9.2 of the Credit Unions Part of the PRA Rulebook; and", "target_text": "A credit union must hold liquid assets equal to at least 10% of its total relevant liabilities .", "source_passage_id": "f2622a90a592c4ce", "target_passage_id": "738a19e25819dedf", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "professional"}

In practice, the plan should be forward-looking and timed so that capital is secured before pressures materialise, rather than reacting when buffers are already at risk. It should also support the bank’s stated path to profitability, recognising that prolonged unprofitability increases uncertainty about continued positive investor sentiment, and that delayed capital raising can distract management at critical moments. Together, these points frame credible planning as both a prudential safeguard and a governance discipline to avoid buffer entry driven by avoidable timing failures.", "source_text": "New and growing banks are often loss making initially and rely on regular capital injections to maintain their capital adequacy. The PRA understands this is often a feature of new businesses, but it is of course not sustainable over the longer term and creates a vulnerability to capital not being available when needed. Banks should focus on reaching profitability and the ability to achieve organic capital generation within a reasonable time period following authorisation, recognising that the longer they are unprofitable, the more uncertainty there is about whether investor sentiment will remain positive. By around three years post-authorisation, the PRA expects banks to have more clarity over their path to profitability. By five years post-authorisation, banks should either be profitable or have a credible strategy to achieve profitability, with definite capital support to achieve this. If the firm is of a size to require minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) at greater than minimum capital requirements within this planning horizon, it needs to factor in those requirements (see paragraph 4.4 ). The PRA, however, recognises that a number of factors, including the nature of the business model, could impact the path to profitability, and will apply flexibility in exceptional circumstances where the path to profitability is credible and there is sufficient financial resources in place in advance to manage the risks around that path. At least until profitability is achieved, the PRA expects firms to have a credible capital plan which will ensure new capital is injected in good time to avoid capital requirements plus buffers being entered. There will be no delay in transitioning to the PRA buffer on a stress test basis (see Chapter 4 ) if there is a delay in achieving profitability.", "target_text": "Poor capital management is a common theme across new and growing banks, with such banks often leaving it to the last minute before securing the investment needed to continue operating without entering capital buffers.

Because it is a linear component, the firm must calculate MCR(l,gi) using the same approach that applies to the relevant linear MCR measures: the rule requires that MCR(gi,gi) and MCR(l,gi) be calculated in the same way as MCR(linear,gi) and MCR(linear,l) respectively [#TGT:696a8ad3ed7cf478]. However, even when the firm follows that same calculation method, it cannot use just any technical provisions or premiums written as inputs. The technical provisions or premiums written used in the calculation must be restricted so they only relate to the firm’s general insurance and reinsurance obligations [#TGT:696a8ad3ed7cf478]. So, in practice, the firm should treat MCR(l,gi) as the specific linear component for long-term obligations connected to general insurance business, apply the required linear calculation approach, and exclude any technical provisions or premiums written that do not relate to general insurance and reinsurance obligations [#SRC:bcc921ae0bcf10dd] [#TGT:696a8ad3ed7cf478].", "source_text": "(2) MCR(l,gi) denotes the linear formula component for long-term insurance and reinsurance obligations relating to general insurance business calculated in accordance with 4A.5 .", "target_text": "MCR (gi,gi) and MCR (l,gi) must be calculated in the same way as MCR (linear,gi) and MCR (linear,l) referred to in Minimum Capital Requirement 3B and 3C respectively, but the technical provisions or premiums written used in the calculation must only relate to the firm’s general insurance and reinsurance obligations .", "source_passage_id": "bcc921ae0bcf10dd", "target_passage_id": "696a8ad3ed7cf478", "method": "SCHEMA", "persona": "basic"}

In practice, this means that when Institutions establish the relevant hedging sets for each risk category of a netting set and assign each transaction to those hedging sets [#TGT:618dbcc272a2044a], they should treat “j” as the complete identifier set for the interest risk rate hedging sets within that netting set, so that transaction assignment can be performed against a clearly delimited universe of interest risk rate hedging sets. The definition of “j” is netting-set specific and is tied to hedging sets “established in accordance with” the referenced establishment conditions, so Institutions should ensure that the hedging sets they create for interest risk rate are the ones encompassed by that index and that transaction allocation is made to those established sets rather than to any ad hoc or undefined groupings.
