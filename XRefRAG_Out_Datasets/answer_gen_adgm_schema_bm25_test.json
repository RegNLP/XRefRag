    "gold_answer": "In its disclosure pursuant to Rule 11.8.2, a Mining Reporting Entity must include key details about how the Production Target was determined, including the material economic assumptions (or, if commercially sensitive, a statement that they are commercially sensitive and an explanation of the methodology used), all other material assumptions, any statement about forecast commodity pricing being arrived at on reasonable grounds, and the proportions of the Production Target based on Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources (including Inferred Mineral Resources), and any Exploration Target, plus the required viability and cautionary statements where applicable [#TGT:8f759494-7a3a-4888-a07b-abac6b73113a].

    "gold_answer": "For each Islamic Contract included in PSIACOMcredit, an Authorised Person must run through a contract-level process: identify the relevant Islamic Contracts, value the underlying investment or asset for each one, and reduce that value as required to arrive at the contract-specific value used in the PSIACOMcredit calculation [#SRC:ad52577a-53d9-469d-ba7a-ae9b4c0a7787]. If the contract results in a CR Exposure that is not past due for more than 90 days, the Authorised Person must categorise that exposure into one of the specified asset classes (for example, cash items, central government/central bank, bank, corporate, regulatory retail, residential mortgage, commercial real estate, or other Exposures) [#TGT:0699660d-a2de-4359-8468-2d993b6a712f]. This categorisation is the required classification step that the Authorised Person must have in place when it determines the risk weighting or capital charge (CRW) appropriate to the contract. Once the CRW is determined, the Authorised Person applies the relevant formula to calculate PSIACOMcredit for that contract and then sums the PSIACOMcredit across all contracts to determine the total PSIACOMcredit applicable to the Authorised Person [#SRC:ad52577a-53d9-469d-ba7a-ae9b4c0a7787].",

For the collateralised portion, it sets E equal to the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight (CRW) that would apply to that collateral as if the Authorised Person had a direct exposure to it. For the uncollateralised portion, it sets E equal to the E of the CR Exposure minus the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight that is applicable to the obligor. It then calculates RWA amounts using E multiplied by the applicable risk weight and adds up the RWA amounts across all CR Exposures [#TGT:5c99a9f9-b97d-4f45-834a-0562c13cf368].",

    "question": "When a Supplementary Prospectus is filed, under what circumstances may the Regulator require payment of a supplementary fee, and how does that align with the broader situations in which the Regulator is permitted to impose a supplementary fee for substantial additional cost or effort?",
    "gold_answer": "Across both provisions, the Regulator\u2019s ability to impose a supplementary fee is framed as a conditional permission tied to expected substantial additional cost or effort. In the specific context of filing a Supplementary Prospectus, the default position is that filing alone does not lead to any fee; however, if the review of that Supplementary Prospectus will require the Regulator to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort in conducting its review, the Regulator may require payment of a supplementary fee [#SRC:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb]. The broader permission confirms the same underlying threshold\u2014where the Regulator expects to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort\u2014and clarifies that this may arise not only in review of a filing but also in dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or when conducting on-going supervision [#TGT:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080]. Read together, the Supplementary Prospectus scenario is an example of the wider category: a filing that, due to the anticipated burden on the Regulator, can justify a supplementary fee, but only when the substantial-cost/effort condition is met.",
    "generated_answer": "Filing a Supplementary Prospectus does not automatically require a fee; the Regulator may require a supplementary fee only if its review is expected to involve substantial additional cost or substantial additional effort. [#ID:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb] This is consistent with the broader rule that supplementary fees may be imposed whenever the Regulator expects substantial additional costs or effort in dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or during ongoing supervision. [#ID:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080] In other words, a Supplementary Prospectus is treated as a type of \u201cfiling,\u201d and the fee is tied to the incremental burden created by the specific submission rather than the act of filing itself.

    "question": "If an Authorised Person is working out CET1 deductions for investments in CET1 Capital instruments of Relevant Entities, what calculation basis must be used for Trading Book holdings (including any netting rules), and what is the general rule about using gross long positions?",
    "gold_answer": "The two texts together require the Authorised Person to apply a general calculation principle while also following a specific Trading Book method when it applies. The SOURCE states that, for the relevant purposes, the amount of holdings of CET1 Capital instruments and other capital instruments of Relevant Entities to be deducted must be calculated on the basis of gross long positions (and it notes this is subject to another rule) [#SRC:40c66431-d7b0-41ae-bc47-0ae63f4d9454]. The TARGET then explains that, for the relevant purposes, an Authorised Person must make the deductions by calculating holdings in the Trading Book on the basis of the net long position in the same underlying Exposure, but only if the short position\u2019s maturity matches the long position\u2019s maturity or the short has a residual maturity of at least one year [#TGT:f6640865-b279-44c1-941f-091a1619258c].

    "generated_answer": "For CET1 deductions relating to investments in CET1 capital instruments of Relevant Entities, Trading Book holdings must be measured using a net long position approach, not gross, where the long and short positions relate to the same underlying exposure and the short position\u2019s maturity matches the long position or has at least one year remaining. [#f6640865-b279-44c1-941f-091a1619258c] For indirect Trading Book holdings via index securities, the deduction amount is based on the calculated underlying exposure to the Relevant Entities\u2019 capital instruments included in the index.

    "gold_answer": "Filing a Supplementary Prospectus does not automatically result in an extra fee.

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The framework permits the Regulator, when making a disclosure of Confidential Information, to attach conditions to the permission to disclose, to the extent the Regulator considers appropriate. Those conditions may address how the disclosure is managed, including requiring the obtaining of consents and, where appropriate, requiring that information received is subjected to restrictions on further disclosure that are at least equivalent to the relevant confidentiality restrictions. This means the Regulator can structure the permission so that disclosure is not unconditional, but instead is controlled through specified safeguards that govern the handling of the Confidential Information by the recipient. The same permission also allows the Regulator to restrict the uses to which the disclosed Confidential Information may be put, reinforcing that both onward disclosure and downstream use can be constrained as part of the disclosure arrangement. These powers are described as enabling the Regulator to impose conditions on the information disclosed and to restrict uses [#SRC:5b971fba-9c2c-40a0-9b54-e38c1d4d3350], and are reflected in the permission to disclose being made subject to conditions (including consents and equivalent restrictions) insofar as the Regulator considers appropriate [#TGT:98d99b60-b14d-4468-becd-e2c79c8f8b4a].",

    "gold_answer": "Where an SFT is not covered by a qualifying cross product Netting agreement, an Authorised Person must calculate E for the pre settlement Counterparty Exposure based on what it provided under the SFT: if it lent Securities or sold Securities with a commitment to repurchase them later at a specified price and date, E is the latest fair value of the Securities lent or sold; if it lent cash by borrowing Securities or paid cash to buy Securities with a commitment to resell them later at a specified price and date, E is the amount of cash lent or paid [#TGT:9578677d-803d-4f27-b8f6-2e4bdf56805e].

The due diligence must further consider whether the Price Reporting Agency has adequate arrangements to avoid staff conflicts of interest that could materially adversely affect the price establishment process, and whether it maintains adequate complaint resolution mechanisms for its assessment process and methodology [#TGT:8a81e6cb-f1f1-4988-af97-f966f288017a].",

    "gold_answer": "Within two Business Days after the issue of Restricted Securities, the Listed Entity must obtain an undertaking from a suitable entity (such as a bank, trustee, custodian, Recognised Body, CSD, or another entity the Regulator considers suitable) and submit that undertaking to the Regulator [#TGT:6e593960-67c1-4a79-90d0-161055303d76]. The undertaking must cover two key points: the entity will place a holding lock on the Restricted Securities it holds, and it will not release that holding lock unless it first has the Regulator\u2019s prior written consent. At the same time, during the Restriction Period, the Listed Entity, Security Holder, or Controller that is subject to a Restriction Agreement is prohibited from trying to change the restriction framework by amending an executed Restriction Agreement, and is also prohibited from asking for or agreeing to the release of a holding lock that has been imposed under the relevant mechanism [#SRC:344f9898-63f7-4bec-afdc-2c9984f6502d]. Together, these requirements mean the lock must be promptly documented and filed, and no party covered by the Restriction Agreement should initiate or consent to a release during the Restriction Period.",
    "generated_answer": "Within two Business Days after issuing Restricted Securities, the Listed Entity must obtain an undertaking from an appropriate lock manager (e.g., a bank, trustee, custodian, Recognised Body, CSD, or other Regulator-approved entity) and submit that undertaking to the Regulator. [#ID:6e593960-67c1-4a79-90d0-161055303d76] The undertaking must require the lock manager to place a holding lock on the Restricted Securities and not remove it unless the Regulator gives prior written consent. [#ID:6e593960-67c1-4a79-90d0-161055303d76] During the Restriction Period, the Listed Entity and any Security Holder or Controller subject to a Restriction Agreement must not request or agree to releasing a holding lock that was imposed under the relevant rule.

    "question": "For an Authorised Person, what conditions must be satisfied to be treated as Category 2, and how does that classification differ from Category 1 where the Financial Services Permission covers deposit-taking or managing a PSIAu?",
    "gold_answer": "An Authorised Person is in Category 2 where its Financial Services Permission authorises it to carry on one or both of the Regulated Activities of Providing Credit or Dealing in Investments as Principal (and not merely acting as Matched Principal), its dealing activities are not limited in scope in the way contemplated for certain limited dealing permissions, and it does not meet the criteria of Categories 1 or 5 [#SRC:6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f]. The Target text reinforces that Category 2 status is determinatively driven by authorisation for Dealing in Investments as Principal (not only as a Matched Principal) or Providing Credit, together with the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rule 1.3.1, and it also clarifies that where dealing is limited to acting only as Matched Principal, the firm\u2019s activities fall within Category 3A rather than Category 2 [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66]. By contrast, Category 1 is determinatively based on authorisation to Accept Deposits or to Manage a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, provided the Authorised Person does not meet Category 5; other authorisations may exist but do not drive the Category 1 classification [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66].",
    "generated_answer": "An Authorised Person is treated as Category 2 if its Financial Services Permission includes Providing Credit and/or Dealing in Investments as Principal (but not solely as Matched Principal), its dealing is not limited to the restricted matched-principal scope, and it does not meet the criteria for Category 1 or Category 5. [#6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f] Category 1 differs because it is triggered where the Permission authorises Accepting Deposits or Managing a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, provided the firm is not Category 5. [#e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66] In other words, Category 2 is determined by credit/proprietary dealing permissions and the absence of Category 1 activities, while Category 1 is determined by deposit-taking or PSIAu management permissions.
