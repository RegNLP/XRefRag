[#TGT:e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f] In the example, the trader rapidly amasses more than 90% of the physical inventory underlying the crude oil contract, does not offer to lend the crude oil back at a reasonable commercial rate, and then exits the position during the Exchange’s final settlement window at rapidly increasing prices, with the effect of cornering/squeezing the market. [#SRC:350b6237-da6f-47c6-b04c-10caf56bf9d7] That conduct is described as causing an abnormal movement in the price of crude oil contracts for forward month delivery, which aligns with the concept of securing the price at an abnormal or artificial level. [#SRC:350b6237-da6f-47c6-b04c-10caf56bf9d7] The “fusion” point is that the abnormal movement is achieved through the trader’s execution pattern (building the dominant inventory position and unwinding in the final settlement window), which is the type of transaction/order behaviour the rule targets when it is not undertaken for legitimate reasons and in conformity with Accepted Market Practices. [#TGT:e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f] On these facts, the Regulator’s example supports treating the strategy as an abusive squeeze that may contravene the relevant prohibition, while the rule frames the key test as abnormal/artificial price impact coupled with lack of legitimate/accepted-market-practice justification.

(b)	a trader with a long position in bond futures, buys or borrows a large amount of the bonds and either refuses to re-lend these bonds or will only lend them to parties he believes will not re-lend to the market.

bcf80608fdca53d8,"When calculating Exposure value for on-balance sheet derivatives (including written credit protection), how must a firm determine the components that are summed (IFRS on-balance sheet amount plus a potential future exposure add-on), and how must that approach be aligned with the requirement to calculate replacement cost and potential future exposure differently for margined versus unmargined netting sets, including the cap applicable to a margined netting set’s EAD?","For on-balance sheet derivatives, including written credit protection, the firm must calculate the Exposure value as a sum of two elements: (i) the on-balance sheet value determined in accordance with IFRS and (ii) an add-on for potential future exposure calculated under the specified App 4 rules [#SRC:b0cdb789-c9b6-4f36-a6b3-bf1e213d2007]. In applying the Standardised Approach to Counterparty Credit Risk for derivatives and long settlement transactions, the firm must ensure that the replacement cost (RC) and potential future exposure (PFE) components used in its counterparty credit risk framework are calculated differently depending on whether the relevant netting set is margined or unmargined [#TGT:949c0178-dbd8-44f8-b832-e4c2a327c941]. Where the exposure is measured on a margined netting set basis, the firm must also apply the constraint that the EAD for that margined netting set is capped at the EAD of the same netting set calculated on an unmargined basis [#TGT:949c0178-dbd8-44f8-b832-e4c2a327c941]. Together, these requirements mean the summed Exposure value for derivatives must incorporate an IFRS-based amount plus a PFE add-on, while the PFE (and RC) mechanics and any EAD cap must reflect whether netting is treated as margined or unmargined.","In relation to on-balance sheet items:
a.	for SFTs, the Exposure value should be calculated in accordance with IFRS and the Netting requirements referred to in Rule 4.9.14;
b.	for Derivatives, including written credit protection, the Exposure value should be calculated as the sum of the on-balance sheet value in accordance with IFRS and an add-on for potential future Exposure calculated in accordance with Rules A4.6.14 to A4.6.21 of App 4; and
c.	for other on-balance sheet items, the Exposure value should be calculated based on their balance sheet values in accordance with Rule 4.9.3.",Derivatives and long settlement transactions – Standardised Approach to Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). The replacement cost (RC) and the potential future exposure (PFE) components must be calculated differently for margined and unmargined netting sets.

(a)	an explanation as to why the Mining Reporting Entity believes it has a reasonable basis for disclosing a Production Target wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources;
(b)	the level of confidence in relation to which the Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated and the basis for that level of confidence;

The mining reporting entity’s production target is based on its current expectation of future results or events, and should not be solely relied upon by investors when making investment decisions.”
Guidance
Any statement about a Production Target will be deemed to be misleading unless the person making the statement has reasonable grounds for making the statement.  The Regulator considers that it is only under exceptional circumstances that a Mining Reporting Entity might form a view that it has reasonable grounds for a Production Target to be wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources.

(7)	if the Production Target is in part based on an Exploration Target:
(a)	a statement of the factors that lead the Mining Reporting Entity to believe that it has a reasonable basis for disclosing a Production Target based, in part, on an Exploration Target; and
(b)	an at least equally prominent, and proximate, statement to the effect that:

There has been insufficient exploration to determine a Mineral Resource and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Mineral Resources or that the Production Target itself will be realised.”",SCHEMA,dev,basic,05f73fd5-8864-472c-bb5f-16a24a80dae4,8f759494-7a3a-4888-a07b-abac6b73113a,11,11,05f73fd5-8864-472c-bb5f-16a24a80dae4,8f759494-7a3a-4888-a07b-abac6b73113a
289b55da023b2793,"When trading activity might be seen as creating an artificial price, what does the Regulator look at, and how does that connect to the definition of Behaviour that uses transactions or orders to trade to create a false impression or keep prices at an abnormal or artificial level?","The definition focuses on Behaviour where a person effects transactions or orders to trade without legitimate reasons and not in line with Accepted Market Practices, and the activity either gives (or is likely to give) a false or misleading impression about supply, demand or price, or secures the price at an abnormal or artificial level for one or more Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets or Accepted Spot Commodities [#TGT:e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f]. When the Regulator considers whether conduct creates, or is likely to create, an artificial price, it is likely to take into account practical indicators that show whether the trading could be driving an artificial outcome [#SRC:96c3bd3c-9315-4058-adc7-295da9439bb1]. These indicators include: (1) how much the person had a direct or indirect interest in the price or value of the relevant instrument or asset; (2) whether price, rate or option-volatility movements (and the volatility of those factors) are outside normal intra-day, daily, weekly or monthly ranges; and (3) whether the person repeatedly and consistently moved their bid, Offer, or the price paid up or down over time. The Regulator uses these factors to connect observed trading patterns to the risk of a false impression or an abnormal/artificial price level.","Factors relating to creating an artificial price. In considering whether or not conduct creates, or is likely to create, an artificial price under section 92(4)(b), the Regulator is likely to take into account factors such as:
(a)	the extent to which the person had a direct or indirect interest in the price or value of the Financial Instrument, an Accepted Virtual Asset or an Accepted Spot Commodity;
(b)	the extent to which price, rate or option volatility movements, and the volatility of these factors for the Financial Instrument, an Accepted Virtual Asset or an Accepted Spot Commodity in question, are outside their normal intra-day, daily, weekly or monthly range; or
(c)	whether a person has successively and consistently increased or decreased his bid, Offer or the price he has paid for a Financial Instrument, an Accepted Virtual Asset or an Accepted Spot Commodity.","The third is where the Behaviour consists of effecting transactions or orders to trade (otherwise than for legitimate reasons and in conformity with Accepted Market Practices on the relevant market) which—
(a)	give, or are likely to give, a false or misleading impression as to the supply of, or demand for, or as to the price of, one or more Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets or Accepted Spot Commodities; or
(b)	secure the price of one or more such instruments at an abnormal or artificial level.",SCHEMA,dev,basic,96c3bd3c-9315-4058-adc7-295da9439bb1,e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f,22,17,96c3bd3c-9315-4058-adc7-295da9439bb1,e14e3ec9-c8a6-4747-a88e-b60c3395238f
