    "question": "When a firm is investing in assets covering technical provisions for linked long-term contracts of insurance, in what circumstances must it still apply the PRA\u2019s expectation to limit its investment where there is insufficient data to quantify asset risks, and when is that expectation outside scope?",
    "gold_answer": "The PRA\u2019s expectation that a firm should limit its investment appropriately where there is insufficient data to quantify the risks arises when the firm is considering the nature and quantification of risks for each category of asset and for individual assets [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8]. However, the scope of the relevant part of the chapter is restricted for firms investing in assets that cover technical provisions (TPs) for linked long-term contracts of insurance: those provisions do not apply to such firms, except in a specific carve-in [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. The carve-in is where the assets are held to cover the additional TPs in respect of policyholder liabilities, including liabilities for any guarantee of investment performance or other guaranteed benefit provided under those linked long-term contracts [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6]. Accordingly, the firm should treat the expectation to limit investment due to insufficient risk data as applicable when the assets fall within that exception (ie, held for additional TPs tied to policyholder liabilities and guarantees), and as not applicable under this chapter where the assets merely cover TPs for linked long-term contracts without meeting the exception [#SRC:e5c80b0f218c00c6] [#TGT:f36a81ef70fe60e8].",
    "generated_answer": "The PRA\u2019s expectation to limit investment where there is insufficient data to quantify asset risks applies to assets covering technical provisions for linked long-term insurance contracts only when, and to the extent that, those assets are held to cover guarantees of investment performance or other guaranteed benefits under the linked contracts. [#cf7f91ae3ffc98a0] In that in-scope situation, the firm must be able to identify and measure the relevant investment risks in line with the prudent person principle, which supports limiting investments whose risks cannot be properly quantified.

    "question": "If a credit union is expected by the PRA to follow concentration limits because it is over \u00a310 million in assets or holds certain investments, do those limits still apply when money is only sitting in an account for a short time before an investment decision is made?",
    "gold_answer": "Reading the two statements together, the PRA sets an expectation that certain credit unions should adhere to concentration limits: specifically, credit unions with more than \u00a310 million in total assets and any credit unions that hold investments that fall under the referenced Rules, with an additional note that there are exceptions for certain listed investments. At the same time, the PRA also explains that the limits are not intended to apply in a particular, narrow situation\u2014where funds are held temporarily in an account before an investment decision is made. So, even if a credit union is within the group the PRA expects to follow the concentration limits, it can treat those limits as not applying to money that is merely parked on a short-term basis while the credit union has not yet decided how to invest it. The key boundary is the purpose and timing of the holding: the carve-out is tied to pre-decision, temporary holding, whereas the expectation to adhere to concentration limits is directed at credit unions meeting the asset-size or investment-holding conditions, subject to the separate investment exceptions.

    "question": "When an Institution is permitted to compute one exposure value across transactions under a contractual netting agreement (subject to the relevant conditions), what must it do in terms of notifying the competent authorities about the calculation method it uses or ceases to use for determining exposure values for derivative positions?",
    "gold_answer": "Where Institutions choose to calculate exposure values for derivative positions using a particular method, they have a notification duty: they shall notify the competent authorities of the methods they use, or cease to use, to calculate the exposure value of their derivative positions [#SRC:7085c26bac1b91bb]. That obligation applies alongside the permission in the netting context: Institutions may calculate a single exposure value for all transactions within a contractual netting agreement only where the specified conditions are met; if those conditions are not met, Institutions must instead calculate an exposure value separately for each transaction, treating each transaction as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Practically, this means that whenever an Institution adopts (or stops using) a method to support either (i) a single exposure value approach for transactions within a contractual netting agreement, or (ii) separate exposure value calculations per transaction, it must notify the competent authorities of the relevant method change or continued use. The notification requirement is framed around the methods used to calculate exposure values, not around the netting permission itself, so Institutions should ensure their notifications align with the method(s) actually applied to the exposure value calculations in either scenario.",

    "question": "After a liability is first recorded, must a firm (and an insurance or reinsurance undertaking) avoid changing the valuation just because its own credit standing changes?",
    "gold_answer": "Yes. The TARGET sets a two-step requirement for a firm: it must value financial liabilities (as referred to in UK-adopted international accounting standards) in the required way when the liability is first recognised, and then it must not make any later adjustment that takes account of a change in the firm\u2019s own credit standing after that initial recognition [#TGT:f26605efb3832de6]. The SOURCE expresses the same type of restriction for a different actor and in a \u201csubsequently\u201d context: it states that there shall be no valuation adjustment to take account of the change in own credit standing of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking [#SRC:d6c3553c96db7f71]. Taken together, the practical rule is consistent across both texts: once the liability valuation is established at the relevant recognition point, later movements in the entity\u2019s own credit standing are not a permitted reason to adjust the valuation. The main difference is only who is being addressed (a firm versus an insurance or reinsurance undertaking) and the explicit linkage in the TARGET to initial recognition and subsequent adjustments.",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. Even if there are amounts that the FSCS has not been able to recover from DGS members as a result of the relevant levy outcomes described in the source, the FSCS is still constrained by the rule that sets a maximum annual amount of DGS compensation costs it can levy on DGS members [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380].

The unrecovered-amounts situation explains that some sums may remain unpaid or uncollected from DGS members, but it does not itself authorize the FSCS to exceed the cap [#SRC:9b7ae1567f99f380]. The only stated way the FSCS can levy more than the cap is if there are exceptional circumstances and the FSCS has the prior consent of the PRA; without that consent (and without exceptional circumstances), charging above the cap is prohibited [#TGT:ba641d05400bc860].",

    "gold_answer": "To apply the PRA\u2019s expectation for branches regarding the level of FSCS-covered retail and small company instant access deposit balances, the firm must first classify which account balances qualify as being in an \u201cinstant access account,\u201d because the expectation is specifically framed around \u201cFSCS covered instant access deposits\u201d held at branches and kept under the stated threshold [#SRC:5ad52e36aa024bad].

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The reduction is required to be carried out by making a deduction from the aggregate value of the assets that the firm would otherwise be permitted to take into account for the relevant purposes. That tells you how the firm must apply the reduction in practice: it is taken off the asset total that would otherwise be counted, rather than being handled as a separate adjustment outside the aggregate asset value. At the same time, the firm\u2019s aggregate value of assets must be reduced by an amount that represents the aggregate of specified components, and that obligation applies subject to the related provisions that frame how the reduction operates. Putting both requirements together, the firm must first identify the reduction amount as the aggregate of the relevant items, and then implement that reduction by deducting that amount from the aggregate asset value it would otherwise be allowed to include. This ensures the reduction is both correctly calculated and correctly applied to the asset base [#TGT:f960c6353f214378] and [#SRC:583731155e8d0cf1].",

    "gold_answer": "The definition operates in two linked steps that must be read together. Ordinarily, the minimum guarantee fund for long-term insurance business is determined by selecting the amount shown in column 2 of the relevant table, matched to the firm\u2019s highest annual contribution income for that business in any preceding financial year (with the income band identified in column 1) [#SRC:7add590aa50e6993]. However, that table-based approach depends on the existence of a preceding financial year from which the firm\u2019s highest annual contribution income can be identified. Where the firm has not been in existence long enough to have a preceding financial year, the definition provides a specific substitute amount: the minimum guarantee fund for long-term insurance business is set at \u00a390,000 [#TGT:57922715d15fab69]. In practice, this means a newly established firm (or one without a completed preceding financial year) does not attempt to infer or approximate a \u201chighest annual contribution income\u201d for table selection; instead, it applies the fixed \u00a390,000 minimum guarantee fund until it has a preceding financial year that enables the standard table correspondence to be used.",

    "gold_answer": "You need to apply two separate percentage limits that address different scopes, and both can matter for the same set of exposures.

    "question": "When an institution is required to stop calculating exposure values for its derivative positions within a six\u2011month period after a triggering event, can it still apply netting to compute a single exposure value across transactions under a contractual netting agreement, and what calculation approach applies if the netting conditions are not met?",
    "gold_answer": "The institution\u2019s starting point is that it has a time\u2011bound obligation to stop calculating exposure values for its derivative positions under the specified calculation approach within six months after a relevant trigger occurs [#SRC:e840f5f94a52b4e7]. Separately, the framework permits institutions to calculate one combined exposure value for all transactions covered by a contractual netting agreement, but only where all the stated conditions for that netting treatment are met [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. If those netting conditions are not met, the institution is not permitted to aggregate and instead must calculate an exposure value for each transaction on a standalone basis, with each transaction treated as its own netting set [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c]. Read together, the permission to use a single exposure value under qualifying contractual netting does not remove or extend the separate requirement to cease the specified exposure\u2011value calculation method within the six\u2011month window; rather, it governs how exposure values may be determined (single netted value versus separate transaction values) in the circumstances where exposure values are being calculated [#SRC:e840f5f94a52b4e7] [#TGT:2e5deb9d3290fa4c].",

    "gold_answer": "The credit union\u2019s compliance check must combine the TARGET obligation with the SOURCE counting rule. Under the TARGET, Subject to 2.3 and 2.4, a credit union must ensure that a member does not have non-deferred shares in the credit union which in aggregate exceed the greater of the applicable limit. When assessing that requirement against the limits in 2.2, the SOURCE provides a specific treatment for a particular type of change: \u201cthe increase in the percentage of the non-deferred shares held by that member is disregarded for the purposes of the limits in 2.2.\u201d Practically, this means that if the member\u2019s position involves an increase in the percentage of non-deferred shares held by that member, the credit union should not count that percentage increase when applying the limits in 2.2 as part of determining whether the member\u2019s aggregate non-deferred shares exceed the greater-of cap described in the TARGET.

    "gold_answer": "The baseline requirement is that the amount of the long-term insurance liability must be determined for each contract by a prospective calculation, which sets the expected method for liability measurement across the portfolio [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb]. The permission to use a retrospective calculation operates only as a constrained carve-out from that default and applies only to determine the liabilities in specific cases [#TGT:30f622a929df3844]. One route is functional impossibility: where a prospective method cannot be applied to a particular type of contract or benefit, a retrospective calculation may be applied for those liabilities notwithstanding the general prospective requirement [#TGT:30f622a929df3844] alongside [#SRC:72c3af495575a5fb]. The other route is an evidentiary demonstration: the entity must be able to demonstrate that the resulting amount of liabilities from the retrospective calculation would be no lower than would be required by a prudent prospective calculation, meaning the retrospective result must not understate liabilities relative to a prudent prospective benchmark [#TGT:30f622a929df3844].",

    "gold_answer": "The institution must calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for its trade exposures with CCPs by summing the exposure values of its trade exposures with CCPs (calculated under the specified paragraphs) and then multiplying that total by the risk weight determined under the specified paragraph [#SRC:99cd1305ee2e0e40]. Separately, the institution may, as a derogation, assign an exposure value of zero to the counterparty credit risk exposures for assets it has posted as collateral to a CCP or to a clearing member, but only if those collateral assets are bankruptcy remote when insolvency occurs [#TGT:3efc66c18754eca4]. The insolvency trigger is not limited to the CCP itself: the condition is met if the CCP, the clearing member, or one or more other clients of the clearing member becomes insolvent, provided the posted collateral remains bankruptcy remote in that scenario. In effect, the required CCP trade-exposure calculation uses exposure values, and the permission allows certain qualifying collateral-related exposure values to be reduced to zero before they feed into the summed amount.",
    "generated_answer": "Yes, but only in a narrow case tied to client portability arrangements. An institution acting as a clearing member may set the exposure value to zero for a contingent obligation that arises from a contractual arrangement with a client of another clearing member, where the arrangement facilitates the transfer of that client\u2019s positions and collateral in line with the relevant EMIR portability provisions.

    "gold_answer": "A firm must ensure its downturn PPGD estimates appropriately reflect economic downturn conditions and are consistent with a fall in property values driven by house price deflation, applying a minimum deflation assumption that is not lower than 25% from the previous peak price and not lower than 5% from the current price [#SRC:12e0a6fed4bfdc7e]. In parallel, when assessing downturn LGD for UK mortgage portfolios, the PRA expects the firm\u2019s rating systems to assume an average reduction in property sales prices of 40% from the peak price prior to the market downturn as an appropriate reference point, and to treat that reduction as capturing both market value decline and a distressed forced sale discount [#TGT:5bb0579cf870e51b]. The firm should therefore calibrate its downturn PPGD and downturn LGD assumptions so they are mutually consistent: the PPGD downturn property-value fall must at least meet the PRA\u2019s deflation floors, while the LGD framework should be anchored to the PRA\u2019s 40% peak-to-downturn sales-price reduction reference point and incorporate the forced-sale component described by the PRA.

    "gold_answer": "A person fits the definition if they are indebted to a society in respect of a loan that is fully secured on land, or, where the Rules so provide, substantially secured on land [#TGT:7856ac9ac9cb1882]. That matters because the permission on derivative investments is framed around limiting exposure to specified changes, including changes in the creditworthiness of any borrower(s) [#SRC:bf19a4f593cb137a]. So, if the society is considering derivatives to manage the risk that a borrower\u2019s ability to repay deteriorates, it should first confirm the borrower is indebted to the society under a qualifying land-secured loan as described in the definition. If that condition is met, the permission supports using derivative investments to limit the extent to which the society, its subsidiary undertaking, or a connected undertaking will be affected by that borrower creditworthiness change. The same permission also covers limiting impacts from interest rates, exchange rates, and certain price indices, but the borrower-creditworthiness link is the key connection to the defined land-secured indebtedness category.",

    "gold_answer": "Institutions must connect their prudent valuation governance and reporting so that, where exposures from the trading book and the non-trading book are adjusted, they can present a clear breakdown of the amounts making up the institution\u2019s prudent valuation adjustment. That breakdown must identify the constituent elements by type of risks and must also show the total of those constituent elements separately for trading book positions and for non-trading book positions [#SRC:2523899445035439]. This reporting obligation sits within, and should be used to demonstrate, the broader requirement that all trading book positions and non-trading book positions measured at fair value are subject to the applicable prudent valuation standards, and that the prudent valuation of trading book positions in particular achieves an appropriate degree of certainty given the dynamic nature of those positions, prudential soundness considerations, and the role and operation of capital requirements for both trading and fair-valued non-trading positions [#TGT:fab620639def0122]. In practice, Institutions should ensure the breakdown is consistent with how positions are classified between books and how fair-valued positions are brought within the prudent valuation standards, so the risk-type components and book-level totals support the required certainty objective.",

    "gold_answer": "The permitted asset exposure limits are defined by reference to the limits that are set out elsewhere, and an Authorised Person should treat those limits as the governing framework for what is permitted in relation to asset exposure [#SRC:4a2c6b4a1519f187]. Within that framework, a specific land-related exposure category is defined as 5% for a piece of land or a number of pieces of land (including one or more interests in such pieces of land) where, in the most recent proper valuation, an aggregate value is ascribed to the relevant pieces of land that is greater than the aggregate of the value of each piece of land or interest valued separately [#TGT:e0fdde5fe1fac33a]. Practically, this means the compliance assessment must (i) identify whether the asset exposure is to a \u201cpiece of land\u201d (or multiple pieces, or interests), (ii) confirm that the valuation used is the most recent proper valuation, and (iii) test whether the valuation methodology produces an aggregate value that exceeds the sum of separate valuations.

    "question": "When deciding what would generally be expected to be written down, what does the law treat as an excluded liability for amounts secured on property, and how does the PRA expect liabilities secured by floating charges to be handled in the creditor hierarchy?",
    "gold_answer": "To decide what would generally be expected to be written down, you need to combine the legal definition of excluded liabilities for secured amounts with the PRA\u2019s stated approach to write-down plans. Legally, an amount secured on property is treated as an excluded liability, but there is an important exception: if the security is a charge that, as created, was a floating charge, that secured amount is not treated as excluded on that basis (Section 377B(1)(d) of FSMA) [#TGT:8a41e3fa3a9296cc]. The PRA then explains how this plays out in practice: it recognises that liabilities secured by floating charges are not excluded liabilities and may therefore be written down, and it links this to avoiding an inappropriate and unintended priority for inward reinsurance creditors who often have floating charges but are contractually subordinated to rank alongside direct policyholders (who have a statutory priority) [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96]. As a result, where floating-charge liabilities are not subordinated in that way, the PRA says they would generally be expected to be written down only after lower-ranking liabilities, following the creditor hierarchy [#SRC:3ab0329fffa4af96].",
    "generated_answer": "For deciding what would generally be expected to be written down, FSMA treats as an \u201cexcluded liability\u201d any amount secured on property, except where the security is a charge that was created as a floating charge (those are not excluded). [#8a41e3fa3a9296cc]\n\nIn the creditor hierarchy, the PRA expects secured liabilities created via floating charges not to undermine the intended subordination of other instruments. [#ba3489fb6075c8f9] In practice, the PRA\u2019s expectation is that claims should rank behind policyholders and beneficiaries (ie, not be treated as effectively senior through encumbrance), so floating-charge secured liabilities should be structured/recognised in a way consistent with that ranking.

    "gold_answer": "If identity verification has not been carried out in line with the relevant anti-money laundering requirements before the firm\u2019s compensation date, the PRA indicates that the relevant insolvency practitioner appointed by the court is allowed to facilitate identity verification for the purpose of determining whether someone is eligible for FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme) protection [#SRC:eb355065b8865baf].

Putting these together, the practitioner should not ignore the missing identity checks: they can use the permitted facilitation route to complete verification needed for the eligibility decision, but they must do so while keeping their broader objectives and responsibilities in view.

Practically, the update should be anchored to the insurer\u2019s risk appetite or tolerance for risk, and supported by a defined process to identify, measure, and monitor risk so that liquidity-related risks are assessed consistently and the strategy and policies remain coherent with the insurer\u2019s overall risk approach [#TGT:e007010cf752bc53]. The insurer must also ensure it has appropriate systems to convey relevant information arising from the liquidity strategy and policy update to management or the board, so that decision-makers receive the necessary inputs and oversight can be exercised effectively [#TGT:e007010cf752bc53].

    "gold_answer": "You must treat the dependant exposure as something that is calculated in a structured way, not estimated informally. Specifically, for each dependant, you calculate its exposure by applying the same provisions used for a firm\u2019s exposure calculation, and you do so as if that dependant were a firm to which those provisions apply, even if it is not actually within scope as a firm [#TGT:d0975ff530ed6e30]. After you have those dependant exposure results, you then adjust the firm\u2019s own exposure figure: the amount of the firm\u2019s exposure to the relevant assets (as determined under the same provisions) must be increased by an additional amount that represents the exposure, if any, of the firm\u2019s dependants to assets of that description [#SRC:250709f3ef53e2f6]. So the sequence is: calculate the firm\u2019s exposure under the provisions, calculate each dependant\u2019s exposure using the same method-as-if-a-firm approach, and then add an increment to the firm\u2019s exposure equal to the dependant exposure amount(s), but only where dependant exposure exists.",

Putting those points together, you should treat the pre\u201131/12/2024 Appendix 1 content as historical and understand that it may not match the latest version of the tests. You should also be aware that there may have been multiple prior versions communicated over time, not just the one captured in the past Appendix 1 reference. When you write up your compliance evidence for the pre\u201131/12/2024 period, make sure you label the version you used as the past Appendix 1 version and distinguish it from the most recent versions the PRA refers to, so there is no confusion about which test set applied to which period [#SRC:64a39e6c30fff620] [#TGT:f7e0497cce253472].",

    "gold_answer": "A firm may be permitted not to comply with certain requirements where, in view of the nature, scale and complexity of its business and the nature and range of the relevant services and activities, compliance would not be proportionate, provided that the firm\u2019s compliance function is, and continues to be, effective [#SRC:029ad42316e71977]. Even where that permission applies, the firm remains subject to an overarching obligation to ensure that the compliance function is able to discharge its responsibilities properly and independently [#TGT:56dd025c30f9e7e2]. Read together, this means the firm cannot treat the proportionality-based non-compliance as a relaxation of the need for an effective compliance function; rather, it must maintain arrangements that support proper and independent performance of the compliance function\u2019s responsibilities while also ensuring the function remains effective on an ongoing basis. The firm should therefore assess proportionality in light of its business and activities, and only rely on the permission if it can demonstrate continuing effectiveness of the compliance function alongside the required ability for that function to operate properly and independently [#SRC:029ad42316e71977] [#TGT:56dd025c30f9e7e2].",

    "gold_answer": "A TWD firm can use the PRA\u2019s templates and accompanying instructions as the main reference point for what the PRA would expect the firm to be able to produce under the SS, because those materials are described as providing a guide to the breadth and granularity of the required data outputs [#TGT:13cf146179026c2c]. Template A (Appendix 1) helps the firm make that expectation more concrete by showing the kind of data breadth and detail that should be available to demonstrate a specific capability: analysing exit costs and liquidity flows. In doing so, Template A highlights that the firm should be able to segment the balance sheet by method and price of exit, which implies the firm\u2019s data production needs to support those breakdowns so the analysis can be performed in a structured way rather than at a single aggregated level [#SRC:87a878c6bb1a14e8]. So, the firm should compare what it can currently produce against the PRA\u2019s templates/instructions generally, and then use Template A as a focused check that it can produce sufficiently granular, segmented balance-sheet data to support exit-cost and liquidity-flow analysis as expected [#TGT:13cf146179026c2c] [#SRC:87a878c6bb1a14e8].",

    "gold_answer": "In determining whether a deposit falls within the scope of the rule that decides if it is an eligible deposit, a firm must apply the PRA\u2019s expectation that it takes reasonable steps to ascertain a local authority\u2019s annual budget, because that information is relevant to whether the local authority is eligible for the purposes of the eligibility determination [#TGT:02fb0fbf6939a082]. The firm may rely on a reasonable estimate of the annual budget provided by the local authority, including an estimate based on the previous year\u2019s budget, as an acceptable means of meeting this expectation where direct confirmation is not available [#SRC:6c7186a4053377c4]. However, if after taking reasonable steps the firm is unable to determine whether the local authority is eligible, the firm must treat the local authority as a public authority for the purposes of applying the eligibility framework to the deposit [#SRC:6c7186a4053377c4]. This approach ensures the firm\u2019s eligibility assessment is grounded in a documented attempt to obtain budget information while still providing a clear classification outcome when eligibility cannot be confirmed, so the deposit can be assessed consistently under the rule\u2019s eligibility provisions [#TGT:02fb0fbf6939a082].",

    "gold_answer": "The firm should use a data series of appropriate length so it can produce a reasonable estimate of the long-run default rate, rather than relying on an arbitrarily short or convenient window [#SRC:bbb89e949553ef1a]. For PDs that are long-run averages of one-year default rates for obligor grades or pools, the PRA expects the firm to estimate expected default rates over a representative mix of good and bad economic periods, instead of simply taking the historic average of default rates the firm actually incurred over a period of years [#TGT:13e5135f24e80eea]. This means the \u201cright\u201d length is the one that helps capture that representative mix, not just the number of years on hand. The PRA also expects that the long-run estimate should be changed when there is reason to believe the current estimate is no longer accurate, but it should not be automatically updated to add each new year of experience, because those additional years may not be representative of the long-run average [#TGT:13e5135f24e80eea].

    "gold_answer": "For CET1 and AT1, a firm must notify the PRA ahead of time when it intends to issue the instrument or when it intends to amend or vary its terms, as long as the instrument will count towards regulatory capital resources or own funds.

This matches the PRA Rulebook description that CET1 and AT1 issuances require pre-issuance notification [#TGT:b9bc12dacc3dd268]. Tier 2 is handled differently: instead of a one-month pre-notice, the firm must notify the PRA immediately after it issues a Tier 2 capital instrument, and immediately after it amends or varies the terms of a Tier 2 capital instrument, where it will count towards regulatory capital resources or own funds [#SRC:1fbc1202165b9d05].

    "gold_answer": "In this context, IFRS 9 is the accounting standard that sets the rules for accounting for financial instruments and replaces the earlier rules in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1]. The PRA expects firms to hold a larger buffer or strengthen their capital position where necessary, and it will also assess firms\u2019 capital positions under transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 until the end of 2023 where firms are using these arrangements [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7].

Putting these together, when the PRA assesses a firm\u2019s capital position under the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements through end-2023, the relevant accounting baseline is the IFRS 9 framework (issued July 2014; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018; replacing IAS 39) that governs financial instruments accounting [#SRC:ca2603599644f9a7] [#TGT:9d3a529207cb52b1].",

In other words, while the calculation outcome must reflect netting for intra-group transactions and the intra-group reinsurance adjustments, the undertaking does not have to maintain a broader documentation set or data directory for this specific purpose; it may confine its documentation and data directory to what supports the adjustment calculations that underpin the net best estimate requirement [#TGT:d7ed04a82cc5b9cd] [#SRC:653a9391c7e21366].",

In applying that obligation, \u201cmaterial outsourcing\u201d should be interpreted by reference to whether the outsourced services fall within scope of OCIR, because where a firm outsources services to which OCIR applies, the arrangement will generally constitute material outsourcing [#TGT:460ccc4d06705d20]. Even where OCIR does not apply, an outsourcing or non-outsourcing third party arrangement may still be material outsourcing if it could affect the PRA\u2019s objectives outside an OCIR context, including where it involves personal or sensitive data or carries high reputational risk [#TGT:460ccc4d06705d20]. The PRA also expects firms to submit notifications before an outsourcing arrangement that was not initially deemed material is expected or planned to become material, and it will consider the timeliness of notifications when assessing compliance with Fundamental Rule 7 [#SRC:4feca3a835842f71].",
    "generated_answer": "For PRA purposes, \u201cmaterial outsourcing\u201d should be read broadly as equivalent to a \u201ccritical or important outsourcing\u201d arrangement under relevant retained EU legislation or PRA rules, using criteria that are substantively aligned to the EBA Outsourcing Guidelines (with limited, justified differences).

    "gold_answer": "An insurer must design and use its risk monitoring metrics in a way that directly supports how it determines, maintains, and evidences any liquidity buffer(s) it holds, because those metrics are part of the framework used to size and track liquid resources against expected outflows [#SRC:9c279e6bff2a8352]. In parallel, the insurer is required to invest in assets that ensure the liquidity of its investment portfolio and to consider whether its assets are appropriate to meet obligations as they fall due, which includes considering total liquidity needs and the level and monitoring of liquid assets [#TGT:69f861caa7c533e0]. Practically, this means the insurer\u2019s metrics should be capable of monitoring liquid assets and informing decisions about an appropriate liquidity buffer, including under stressed conditions, so the insurer can demonstrate it maintains an adequate stock of liquid assets sufficient to meet liabilities as they fall due [#TGT:69f861caa7c533e0].

    "gold_answer": "Where reporting is being made on a group that includes more than one firm using an internal model, Firms and, where applicable, UK holding companies must submit to the PRA an annual analysis-of-change return using template AoC.01, and that submission must include both quantitative information and a supporting qualitative analysis, prepared in line with the relevant instructions for the template [#TGT:d0d445db94d0c556].

    "gold_answer": "Yes. Once an SPF for restructuring becomes payable because a firm engages, or prepares to engage, in activity that involves it undertaking or making arrangements with a view to the specified outcomes, the payable amount must be calculated in a way that also captures certain external costs incurred by the PRA. The procedure says to add any fees and disbursements that a third party provider invoices to the PRA, but only where those charges are for services performed for the PRA and are connected to assisting the PRA in carrying out the relevant regulatory work. In other words, the trigger for payment is the firm\u2019s engagement (or preparation to engage) in the restructuring activity [#TGT:28f11ba870345a3b], and the calculation step requires including third\u2011party invoiced fees and disbursements to the PRA that relate to supporting the PRA\u2019s performance of that regulatory work [#SRC:f9e22b9441fa0c58].",

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The FSCS must reimburse interest owed on eligible deposits where the interest had accrued but had not been credited at the compensation date, except where the compensation sum arises from a temporary high balance [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f]. However, paying that interest does not increase the depositor\u2019s compensation beyond the maximum compensation sum payable for the depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits. The definition sets that maximum at \u00a3120,000 for each depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits, while also noting that additional compensation may be payable in certain cases [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e]. The interest reimbursement is therefore required, but it is capped: the FSCS must ensure that the payment of accrued-but-uncredited interest does not cause the depositor\u2019s compensation to exceed the maximum compensation sum [#SRC:04c5ad45b6092e9f], as that maximum is defined for the depositor\u2019s aggregate eligible deposits [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e]. If a depositor is in a category where additional compensation may be payable under the definition\u2019s carve-out, that may affect the overall amount, but the general rule remains that interest reimbursement cannot be used to breach the stated maximum [#TGT:336f75f8cdcde56e].",

    "gold_answer": "RoA is defined as a metric computed by taking net income divided by total assets and then averaging that ratio over a two-year period, so the calculation requires a consistent identification of both the numerator and denominator across the relevant years [#SRC:005b0d8588b51505]. The \u201cnet income\u201d component used as the numerator is not left to general interpretation; it is specifically tied to a FINREP data point, meaning net income must be taken from row 355, column 01 of template F02.00 (FINREP) [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4]. Read together, this means the RoA numerator must be sourced from that precise FINREP location for each year included in the two-year averaging window, while the denominator remains total assets as required by the RoA calculation construct [#SRC:005b0d8588b51505]. Accordingly, compliance hinges on (i) using the FINREP-defined net income figure as the numerator and (ii) applying it in the ratio to total assets, with the resulting annual ratios then averaged over two years, ensuring the same definitional basis for net income throughout [#TGT:faed71864e571bf4].",

    "question": "For a relevant currency, how should the ultimate forward rate be defined in terms of whether it incorporates any compensation for long-term investment risk, and what procedural constraints govern when the PRA may adjust that rate to preserve stability?",
    "gold_answer": "The ultimate forward rate should be understood as a long-term rate that is not uplifted by any additional component intended to compensate for the extra risk of holding long-term investments; in other words, it is defined without a term premium for that purpose [#TGT:87cfaaafc6a4804d]. Procedurally, for each relevant currency the PRA sets the ultimate forward rate by taking account of expectations of the long-term real interest rate and expected inflation, but only where those expectations can be determined reliably for that currency [#SRC:07f28fc667f26c18]. Consistent with its stated objective to maintain stability in the ultimate forward rate for each relevant currency, the PRA will only make changes to the rate where there are changes in long-term expectations, rather than making adjustments for other factors such as adding a risk-related premium [#SRC:07f28fc667f26c18]. In applying this approach, the PRA uses the same methodology as specified by EIOPA in its Report on the Calculation of the UFR for 2024, aligning the calculation process with that methodology while preserving the definition that excludes a term premium [#SRC:07f28fc667f26c18] [#TGT:87cfaaafc6a4804d].",

First, determine whether the relevant risks are already mitigated through the risk based capital framework or by other means, as this indicates the risk is addressed within the capital-based approach or an alternative mitigation method recognized in the same context [#SRC:d59b0f174c2241e4]. Second, assess whether the risk of the local entity is mitigated at the group level through risk management processes or internal control mechanisms established at the group level, which frames mitigation as arising from group-level governance and controls rather than solely from capital treatment [#TGT:7a8270fc93e6d439]. Where both appear to apply, the assessment should explain how the group-level processes or controls interact with, complement, or substitute for the capital framework or other means, so that the conclusion that the risk is \u201calready mitigated\u201d is traceable to the specific mechanism relied upon and avoids double-counting the same mitigation effect.",

    "gold_answer": "A UK Solvency II firm, the Society and managing agents must implement and maintain a risk management system that is not only maintained as an ongoing control framework, but is also structured to embed approved risk tolerance limits that implement the insurer\u2019s risk strategy and facilitate control mechanisms [#SRC:6ed49c6d770ad510].

    "gold_answer": "If a pooled asset exposure\u2019s underlying assets are exposed to economic risks, and the firm has enough evidence that the exposure is predictable, the firm may propose to apply the standard approach to the FS addition for event risks [#SRC:957d2122eefbf855]. In doing so, the firm should define the relevant event risk in the way the PRA characterises it: event-driven cash flow variability risks are more likely to be appropriately represented using fatter-tailed distributions, meaning the firm should not assume that event impacts on cash flows are narrowly distributed around the average [#TGT:24cba8bb8769696c]. Where more complete credible data becomes available to support more sophisticated modelling, the PRA links this definition to a practical benchmark for provision: a provision equal to one quarter of the difference in MA benefit from median to worst cash flows is described as broadly equivalent to targeting the 85th percentile of a fatter-tailed distribution, and this would likely demonstrate adequate provision for the additional retained cash flow variability risks [#TGT:24cba8bb8769696c].

In parallel, the firm must ensure independent oversight of the procedures that govern how such matters are handled by subjecting those procedures to assessment by assurance functions, specifically including compliance, operational risk and internal audit [#SRC:05c733f03ee2bae2]. Read together, this means the firm should not allow ad hoc departures from the policy: deviations must be channelled through the documented approval pathway, and the underlying procedures supporting that pathway should be independently assessed by the named assurance functions. This combination supports both front-line control (rare, explicitly approved, policy-documented exceptions with firm involvement) and second/third-line challenge (assurance assessment of the procedures) to help ensure deviations are justified, consistently processed, and appropriately governed across the firm [#TGT:00ebc8f04ba1902a] [#SRC:05c733f03ee2bae2].",

    "gold_answer": "The procedure is to start by using Table A as the controlling framework for categorising the relevant EU-based reference and applying the default approach specified for how that reference should be interpreted [#SRC:dd9730c74dae4fce]. Then, when you encounter drafting that uses the Euro as an example of a currency, you should check whether the provision applies the same treatment to other currencies (for example, US dollars). If the treatment is the same, you should proceed on the basis that no adjustment is needed to the interpretive outcome you would otherwise reach under the Table A default approach; in other words, the example currency does not trigger a different reading or a separate interpretive step [#TGT:0f091b34fb7fe524]. Operationally, this means you document that the Euro reference is illustrative, confirm equivalence of treatment across currencies, and continue applying the Table A default interpretation without modification. This aligns the general default interpretive method for EU-based references with the specific instruction that currency examples do not, by themselves, require interpretive change when the underlying treatment is consistent.",

    "question": "What does \u201csleeper collateral\u201d mean for an insurer, and why is it relevant when counterparties or other market participants create liquidity stress by recalling it or triggering collateral posting issues?",
    "gold_answer": "For an insurer, \u201csleeper collateral\u201d means the value of collateral the insurer is already contractually required to post to a counterparty, but has not actually posted yet because the counterparty has not called for it [#TGT:17e755beec91fb74]. It becomes relevant in liquidity-stress analysis because the source describes how actions of counterparties and other market participants can create liquidity stresses that adversely affect the insurer, including by recalling sleeper collateral, by situations where collateral required is not posted, or by opening valuation disputes [#SRC:4fbd64abc69cb404]. In practical terms, the definition clarifies that sleeper collateral is not \u201coptional\u201d collateral; it is an existing obligation that is simply untriggered until a call occurs. Under the stressed conditions described, a call or recall can rapidly turn that unposted obligation into a near-term liquidity need, potentially alongside market price impacts from other participants selling similar assets the insurer may rely on for liquidity.",
    "generated_answer": "I cannot answer based on the provided passages. The passages discuss liquidity stress reporting, counterparty-triggered collateral calls, and how derivatives and clearing can create liquidity needs when collateral or cash variation margin must be posted, including constraints in credit support annexes.

    "question": "If firms have to make sure they can keep delivering their important business services within impact tolerances, what should they do in practice, and where does the March 2021 SS1/21 link point them to find the relevant document?",
    "gold_answer": "Firms must take action to ensure they are able to deliver their important business services within their impact tolerances, after the Operational Resilience Parts of the PRA Rulebook and SS1/21 have required and expected them to identify those important business services and set impact tolerances for them [#SRC:f9622b5d346bca89]. In practice, the passage explains that firms should test against severe but plausible operational disruption scenarios so they can identify vulnerabilities and take mitigating action; and if deficiencies are found, the PRA\u2019s operational resilience policy requires boards and senior management to drive improvement, linking operational testing outcomes to governance-led remediation [#SRC:f9622b5d346bca89].

In that situation, the relevant insurance group undertakings or any UK holding company must report to the group supervisor any significant risk concentration at the level of the group [#TGT:58ef7092c29ce99f].

    "question": "When designing and operating its risk-management system, what must the firm do to ensure it covers risks included (and not fully included) in the SCR calculation, and how must the firm\u2019s calibration approach ensure that all quantifiable risks\u2014at least those enumerated\u2014are taken into account?",
    "gold_answer": "The firm must ensure its risk-management system is effective and well integrated into its organisational structure and decision-making processes, with proper consideration of the persons who have key functions, and it must cover both the risks to be included in the SCR calculation and the risks that are not, or not fully, included in that calculation [#SRC:ec68cf68d094e876]. Alongside this system-level coverage obligation, the firm must ensure that the relevant calibration is set so that all quantifiable risks to which the firm is exposed are taken into account, including at least non-life underwriting risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk, market risk, credit risk, and operational risk [#TGT:f261181a95a3ca51]. Together, these requirements mean the firm cannot treat SCR risk coverage as limited to a narrow set of modeled items: the risk-management system must be broad enough to capture SCR-included risks and any residual or excluded risks, while the calibration requirement ensures that, for quantifiable exposures, the firm\u2019s approach explicitly incorporates the minimum specified risk categories and does not leave out other quantifiable risks.",

Read together, this means the scrutineers report is not only a mandatory component of each confirmation application, but it may also be expanded to include diagnostic commentary and root-cause analysis to assist the PRA\u2019s assessment, particularly in cases where invalid voting could be material to the integrity of the member decision-making process.",
