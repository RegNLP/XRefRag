    "gold_answer": "In its disclosure pursuant to Rule 11.8.2, a Mining Reporting Entity must include key details about how the Production Target was determined, including the material economic assumptions (or, if commercially sensitive, a statement that they are commercially sensitive and an explanation of the methodology used), all other material assumptions, any statement about forecast commodity pricing being arrived at on reasonable grounds, and the proportions of the Production Target based on Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources (including Inferred Mineral Resources), and any Exploration Target, plus the required viability and cautionary statements where applicable [#TGT:8f759494-7a3a-4888-a07b-abac6b73113a].

    "gold_answer": "For each Islamic Contract included in PSIACOMcredit, an Authorised Person must run through a contract-level process: identify the relevant Islamic Contracts, value the underlying investment or asset for each one, and reduce that value as required to arrive at the contract-specific value used in the PSIACOMcredit calculation [#SRC:ad52577a-53d9-469d-ba7a-ae9b4c0a7787]. If the contract results in a CR Exposure that is not past due for more than 90 days, the Authorised Person must categorise that exposure into one of the specified asset classes (for example, cash items, central government/central bank, bank, corporate, regulatory retail, residential mortgage, commercial real estate, or other Exposures) [#TGT:0699660d-a2de-4359-8468-2d993b6a712f]. This categorisation is the required classification step that the Authorised Person must have in place when it determines the risk weighting or capital charge (CRW) appropriate to the contract.

For the collateralised portion, it sets E equal to the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight (CRW) that would apply to that collateral as if the Authorised Person had a direct exposure to it. For the uncollateralised portion, it sets E equal to the E of the CR Exposure minus the latest fair value of the eligible financial Collateral and applies the risk weight that is applicable to the obligor. It then calculates RWA amounts using E multiplied by the applicable risk weight and adds up the RWA amounts across all CR Exposures [#TGT:5c99a9f9-b97d-4f45-834a-0562c13cf368].",

    "question": "When a Supplementary Prospectus is filed, under what circumstances may the Regulator require payment of a supplementary fee, and how does that align with the broader situations in which the Regulator is permitted to impose a supplementary fee for substantial additional cost or effort?",
    "gold_answer": "Across both provisions, the Regulator\u2019s ability to impose a supplementary fee is framed as a conditional permission tied to expected substantial additional cost or effort. In the specific context of filing a Supplementary Prospectus, the default position is that filing alone does not lead to any fee; however, if the review of that Supplementary Prospectus will require the Regulator to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort in conducting its review, the Regulator may require payment of a supplementary fee [#SRC:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb]. The broader permission confirms the same underlying threshold\u2014where the Regulator expects to incur substantial additional costs or expend substantial additional effort\u2014and clarifies that this may arise not only in review of a filing but also in dealing with an application, authorisation, filing, or when conducting on-going supervision [#TGT:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080]. Read together, the Supplementary Prospectus scenario is an example of the wider category: a filing that, due to the anticipated burden on the Regulator, can justify a supplementary fee, but only when the substantial-cost/effort condition is met.",

[#ID:cec237a1-c364-4ed0-9197-dcac6160defb] This is consistent with the broader rule that supplementary fees may be imposed whenever the Regulator expects substantial additional costs or effort in handling an application, authorisation, filing, or ongoing supervision. [#ID:64a0df5a-e946-4496-9fd3-244340c2a080] In other words, a Supplementary Prospectus is treated as a specific example of a \u201cfiling\u201d where extra regulatory work can justify an additional charge.

[#ID:0fcdb1be-2257-451f-b7b3-983073f4f680] For securitisation (SE) Exposures, the same FCCA concept applies: the Authorised Person calculates E* under Section A4.3 and uses it in place of E when determining RWAs under Section 4.8. [#ID:2126f70f-d77a-4604-bdbd-ccea38d0975f] By contrast, under the Financial Collateral Simplified Approach (FCSA), the treatment is tied to the composition rules in Rule 4.13.5 and recognition is performed under Section 4.13 rather than via an E* adjustment.

    "gold_answer": "The two texts together require the Authorised Person to apply a general calculation principle while also following a specific Trading Book method when it applies. The SOURCE states that, for the relevant purposes, the amount of holdings of CET1 Capital instruments and other capital instruments of Relevant Entities to be deducted must be calculated on the basis of gross long positions (and it notes this is subject to another rule) [#SRC:40c66431-d7b0-41ae-bc47-0ae63f4d9454].

    "gold_answer": "Yes. The framework permits the Regulator, when making a disclosure of Confidential Information, to attach conditions to the permission to disclose, to the extent the Regulator considers appropriate. Those conditions may address how the disclosure is managed, including requiring the obtaining of consents and, where appropriate, requiring that information received is subjected to restrictions on further disclosure that are at least equivalent to the relevant confidentiality restrictions. This means the Regulator can structure the permission so that disclosure is not unconditional, but instead is controlled through specified safeguards that govern the handling of the Confidential Information by the recipient. The same permission also allows the Regulator to restrict the uses to which the disclosed Confidential Information may be put, reinforcing that both onward disclosure and downstream use can be constrained as part of the disclosure arrangement. These powers are described as enabling the Regulator to impose conditions on the information disclosed and to restrict uses [#SRC:5b971fba-9c2c-40a0-9b54-e38c1d4d3350], and are reflected in the permission to disclose being made subject to conditions (including consents and equivalent restrictions) insofar as the Regulator considers appropriate [#TGT:98d99b60-b14d-4468-becd-e2c79c8f8b4a].",

    "question": "What does a Listed Entity have to do within two Business Days after issuing Restricted Securities to ensure a holding lock is put in place, and what must it (and any Security Holder or Controller under a Restriction Agreement) not do during the Restriction Period about releasing that lock?",
    "gold_answer": "Within two Business Days after the issue of Restricted Securities, the Listed Entity must obtain an undertaking from a suitable entity (such as a bank, trustee, custodian, Recognised Body, CSD, or another entity the Regulator considers suitable) and submit that undertaking to the Regulator [#TGT:6e593960-67c1-4a79-90d0-161055303d76]. The undertaking must cover two key points: the entity will place a holding lock on the Restricted Securities it holds, and it will not release that holding lock unless it first has the Regulator\u2019s prior written consent. At the same time, during the Restriction Period, the Listed Entity, Security Holder, or Controller that is subject to a Restriction Agreement is prohibited from trying to change the restriction framework by amending an executed Restriction Agreement, and is also prohibited from asking for or agreeing to the release of a holding lock that has been imposed under the relevant mechanism [#SRC:344f9898-63f7-4bec-afdc-2c9984f6502d]. Together, these requirements mean the lock must be promptly documented and filed, and no party covered by the Restriction Agreement should initiate or consent to a release during the Restriction Period.",
    "generated_answer": "Within two Business Days after issuing Restricted Securities, the Listed Entity must obtain an undertaking from an appropriate intermediary (e.g., a bank, trustee, custodian, Recognised Body, CSD, or other Regulator-approved entity) to apply a holding lock to the Restricted Securities and submit that undertaking to the Regulator. [#ID:6e593960-67c1-4a79-90d0-161055303d76] The undertaking must also confirm the lock will not be released unless the Regulator has given prior written consent. [#ID:6e593960-67c1-4a79-90d0-161055303d76] During the Restriction Period, the Listed Entity, and any Security Holder or Controller subject to a Restriction Agreement, must not request or agree to releasing a holding lock imposed under the relevant rule.

    "question": "For an Authorised Person, what conditions must be satisfied to be treated as Category 2, and how does that classification differ from Category 1 where the Financial Services Permission covers deposit-taking or managing a PSIAu?",
    "gold_answer": "An Authorised Person is in Category 2 where its Financial Services Permission authorises it to carry on one or both of the Regulated Activities of Providing Credit or Dealing in Investments as Principal (and not merely acting as Matched Principal), its dealing activities are not limited in scope in the way contemplated for certain limited dealing permissions, and it does not meet the criteria of Categories 1 or 5 [#SRC:6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f]. The Target text reinforces that Category 2 status is determinatively driven by authorisation for Dealing in Investments as Principal (not only as a Matched Principal) or Providing Credit, together with the absence of authorisation for the activities specified in Rule 1.3.1, and it also clarifies that where dealing is limited to acting only as Matched Principal, the firm\u2019s activities fall within Category 3A rather than Category 2 [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66]. By contrast, Category 1 is determinatively based on authorisation to Accept Deposits or to Manage a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, provided the Authorised Person does not meet Category 5; other authorisations may exist but do not drive the Category 1 classification [#TGT:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66].",
    "generated_answer": "An Authorised Person is treated as Category 2 where its Financial Services Permission authorises it to conduct Providing Credit and/or Dealing in Investments as Principal (but not solely as Matched Principal), its dealing activities are not limited in the way described in Rule 1.3.3(1)(a)(i), and it does not meet the criteria for Category 1 or Category 5. [#ID:6737c8c3-06cb-4da7-bbcd-9e8650ecf66f] By contrast, Category 1 applies when the Permission includes Accepting Deposits or Managing a Profit Sharing Investment Account that is a PSIAu, provided the firm is not Category 5. [#ID:e705fde9-d397-4a9f-b5a0-471529529c66] In Category 1, that deposit-taking/PSIAu authorisation is the determinative feature even if other regulated activities are also authorised.
