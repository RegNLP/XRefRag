[#TGT:07c1a4bc-0a9d-43a2-83b5-5e59dc8356dd] However, for that defined benefit pension fund asset deduction, the amount deducted can be reduced in two ways: first, by the amount of any associated deferred tax liability that could be extinguished if the pension assets became impaired or were derecognised under the International Financial Reporting Standards; and second, by the amount of pension fund assets that the Authorised Person has an unrestricted ability to use, but only where it has provided adequate advance notification to the Regulator that it intends to use those assets.
