    "gold_answer": "A Relevant Person conducting a business risk assessment that addresses NFTF business and the use of eKYC Systems must both (i) identify and assess the money laundering risks its business faces and (ii) ensure the assessment is operationalised through mitigation in day-to-day activities, while considering relevant external mitigation measures.

    "gold_answer": "For an Offer involving Units, the combined effect is that the Chapter\u2019s provisions (and Rules made for that Chapter) do not apply to the person making the Offer, and the Rulebook\u2019s chapter 4 Prospectus content and structure requirements are also not applicable to Prospectuses relating to Units of Funds.

[#SRC:254251bf-b846-4357-af1b-961bfa5fff94] Instead, the Prospectus requirements that do apply to an Offer of Units of Funds are located in the Fund Rules, which are identified as the source of applicable Prospectus requirements for such Offers. [#SRC:254251bf-b846-4357-af1b-961bfa5fff94] This allocation is reinforced by the statement that Section 57(1) of FSMR disapplies chapter 4 of the Rulebook to Fund Prospectuses, aligning the Rulebook\u2019s chapter 4 non-application for Units of Funds with the broader non-application framework for the Chapter in relation to making an Offer of a Unit.

    "gold_answer": "To decide whether it must notify the Regulator, an Authorised Person in Category 3B, 3C or 4 needs to compare its Capital Resources to its Capital Requirement, and that Capital Requirement is calculated under Section 3.6 with the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum included as a component. [#SRC:596309d5-cc1a-4a45-9e6d-2042ff11da76] The notification trigger occurs when Capital Resources fall below 120% of the Capital Requirement (meaning the 120% test is applied to the Capital Requirement figure that includes the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum component).

[#SRC:596309d5-cc1a-4a45-9e6d-2042ff11da76] Put together, the compliance steps are: compute the Capital Requirement under Section 3.6 (including the Expenditure Based Capital Minimum), monitor Capital Resources against 120% of that amount, and if the firm falls below, notify immediately and follow up with written confirmation.

[#TGT:2d7f3106-4761-4113-abe3-580e52ee1c85] The eligible categories are: any instrument listed in Rule 4.13.5; any equity Security (including a convertible bond) that is traded on a regulated exchange; and Units in a Collective Investment Fund that invests in those traded equity Securities, but only where the Unit price is publicly quoted daily and at least 90% of the Fund\u2019s deposited property is invested in instruments listed in this Rule and Rule 4.13.5.

[#TGT:d95a8aaf-4663-4372-87b7-54040b62f0ba] For an ADGM Branch, those Resolution Conditions include that the Regulator is satisfied the branch is failing or likely to fail, that (considering timing and other relevant circumstances) it is not reasonably likely that other action by or in respect of the ADGM Branch or the Non-ADGM Institution will prevent that failure or likely failure, and that applying a Resolution Tool is in the public interest.

[#TGT:4797c128-c19a-4af6-89ba-59fb6b9ac4d2] Practically, this means the Rule 3.2.1 fee schedule supplies the relevant per-activity fees, while the multi-activity rule determines that the payable amount is anchored by the highest applicable fee plus capped incremental fees for each additional activity in the same submission.

[#TGT:ffc672ed-a781-4a71-bb0d-7fc38a2e0c7c] That jurisdiction identification matters because the buffer is calculated by taking the Authorised Person\u2019s Total Risk Exposure Amount and multiplying it by a weighted average of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates that apply to exposures in the jurisdictions where those private sector credit exposures are located. [#SRC:61013be0-a186-4ad3-9c9e-4fe2164b5b2c] In other words, the \u201clocation\u201d step determines which jurisdictional buffer rates are considered \u201capplicable\u201d for the weighted average, and the weighted average then directly drives the size of the buffer when applied to the Total Risk Exposure Amount.

    "gold_answer": "A person\u2019s execution of their own pre-formed intention to deal, by itself, is treated as not breaching section 92(2) (Insider Dealing); the compliance focus therefore shifts to whether the dealing is instead connected to \u201cInside Information\u201d as defined for the relevant instruments. [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] For Financial Instruments, Accepted Virtual Assets, Accepted Spot Commodities, and Related Instruments that are not Commodity Derivatives, \u201cInside Information\u201d is limited to information that is precise, not generally available, and that relates (directly or indirectly) to one or more Reporting Entities or Issuers or to the instruments themselves, and that would likely move the price significantly if it became generally available. [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] In practical terms, the firm should (1) confirm the person formed an intention to deal before dealing and recognize that carrying out that intention alone is not the contravention trigger, [#SRC:78dea780-e39f-407d-855f-5cb46c1b30d7] and (2) separately test whether any information influencing the trade meets all elements of the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition (precise, non-public, relevant to Reporting Entities/Issuers or the instruments, and price-significant). [#TGT:ac9dc52d-0e6a-4c83-b170-ffe156109977] This linkage matters because the \u201cown intention\u201d concept addresses the act of dealing, while the \u201cInside Information\u201d definition supplies the characteristics of information that could make dealing problematic under an insider dealing analysis.

[#030e6555-062f-4aee-a31c-6b6041bdc139] Merely carrying out a pre-formed intention to deal does not, by itself, amount to insider dealing.
